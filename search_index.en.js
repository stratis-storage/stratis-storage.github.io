Baublitz, Stratis Team\nOne major focus in the Stratis project recently has been adding an encryption layer\nfor data in Stratis pools. Cryptsetup provides a library backend for programmatically\nsetting up device encryption, so we decided to write Rust bindings to access the\nexisting Cryptsetup functionality in Rust.\nWhile designing the bindings, we took every opportunity to make use of Rust's\ntype system, leveraging features like reference lifetimes and type parameters\nto ensure that as much of our public API as possible can be validated by the\ncompiler.\nThough these bindings were designed with Stratis in mind, it is intended\nto be general-purpose and so we encourage others to try it out. The license\nis MPLv2, but it becomes effectively GPL when linked with libcryptsetup.\nAs a result, any project using our bindings will also need to be GPL or\nGPL-compatible.\nIf you're interested in seeing more, you can find the repository here.\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/cryptsetup/","title":"Cryptsetup Rust bindings release"},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/multi-threading/":{"body":"mulhern, Stratis Team\nIntroducing Support for Multi-threading in stratisd\nstratisd is an entirely single-threaded application;\nit is a daemon with a single event loop that consults a list of possible\nevent sources in a prescribed order, handling the events on each event\nsource before proceeding to the next.\nThe event sources are udev, device-mapper, and D-Bus events which are\nhandled in that order. stratisd can also be terminated cleanly by an\ninterrupt signal, which it checks for on every loop iteration.\nBecause stratisd is single threaded, every action taken by stratisd must be\ncompleted before another action is performed. For example, if a client issues\na D-Bus message to create a filesystem, that command will be processed, the\nengine will create a filesystem, and a response will be transmitted on the\nD-Bus before any other action can be taken. If another D-Bus message is\nreceived before the first is completed, that D-Bus message will then be\nprocessed.  The engine will continue to process D-Bus messages until none are\nleft, preventing it from handling any other categories of signals or\nevents while any D-Bus messages remain.\nFor this reason, stratisd itself can not parallelize long-running\noperations. It is well known that, for example, filesystem creation can be\ntime consuming, as it is necessary to write the filesystem metadata when\ncreating the filesystem. Ideally, stratisd would be able to run such time\nconsuming operations in parallel, initiating one operation and then\nproceeding to initiate another before the first operation completes.\nAdditionally, as in the example above, if stratisd is continually receiving\nD-Bus messages, it will not proceed to deal with a device-mapper event,\neven if the device-mapper event is urgent and not in any conflict with the\nD-Bus messages, for example, if it is associated with a different pool than\nany D-Bus messages.\nFor these reasons, the next release introduces multi-threading capabilities\ninto stratisd. These capabilities do not solve all the problems that\nmulti-threading is intended to solve, but lay the essential foundation for\nmulti-threaded event handling.\nWe have chosen to implement multi-threading using the Rust tokio crate.\nThe alternative is to use operating system threads explicitly via the\nRust standard library thread module. We have chosen tokio in order to\nget the benefits of code reuse from the tokio runtime, and because we\nexpect that this choice will allow stratisd to operate efficiently while\nconsuming fewer operating system resources.\nWe have also made use of the newest version of the dbus crate, which\nincludes support for multi-threading via the dbus-tokio crate.\nNomenclature\nThe following words have a precise definition in the context of\nmulti-threading:\n\nobject - an instance of a Rust struct and the methods implemented for it.\ntask - A task is a program which has been designed so that it can\nbe run concurrently  with its fellow tasks. The multi-threaded incarnation\nof stratisd consists of a set of tasks, some code to facilitate interactions\nbetween the tasks, and the tokio runtime.\ncontext - the context of a process is all the information required to\nbegin running the process when it resumes after having been suspended by the\noperating system scheduler. A context switch is the action of storing this\ninformation for the process being suspended and loading the information for\nthe process being resumed.\nthread - a thread is a sub-division of a process. When an operating system\nswitches processes, a context switch is required. When an operating\nsystem switches threads, the new thread shares much of its process' context\nwith the previous thread. Consequently, switching between threads, as opposed\nto processes, may be an order of magnitude less expensive. All threads\nbelonging to a process share the same memory and may communicate via this\nshared memory.\nruntime - the tokio runtime manages scheduling of tasks.\nblock - a task is said to block on an operation if the task must wait\nfor the operation to complete and is not able to be replaced in the same\nthread by another task until the operation is completed. Examples of typical\noperations are I/O or network interactions. Another sort of operation is\nthe acquisition of a shared resource via a mutex or other synchronization\nprimitive.\nblocking - a blocking task is a task that may block.\nnon-blocking - a non-blocking task is a task that does not need to wait\nfor any operation to complete; if it initiates an operation that may take\na while to complete, it is able to yield to another task, and may be resumed\nlater from the instruction where it yielded.\nmutex - a synchronization primitive which enforces mutual exclusion. With\ntokio the exclusion is enforced on a particular object. If a task obtains\na mutex, it has exclusive use of the object until it releases the mutex.  If\na mutex is already held by another task, a task requesting the mutex may\nblock or it may yield until the mutex can be obtained.\nread/write lock - a mutex which is relaxed in so far as that it allows\nmultiple tasks to share an object if none mutate the object. If a task\nmutates the object then it must obtain exclusive possession of the mutex.\nlock - to enter a mutex guarding an object is synonymous with locking\nan object.\n\nDesign\nstratisd divides its work among a number of tasks which handle\ndifferent event sources. Some tasks are non-blocking, others are blocking\ntasks. Non-blocking tasks may yield, and can share a single thread with\nother non-blocking tasks. The tasks communicate using two unbounded MPSC\n(Multi-Producer Single-Consumer) channels; a channel for udev events and\na channel for D-Bus updates.\nTermination Variable\nOne boolean variable, should_exit, is shared among some of the tasks.\nIt is set to true only if SIGINT is detected. It is observed only by the\nudev task, which checks its value on every iteration of its loop, and\nimmediately returns if the value is true. For all other tasks, termination\nis handled by tokio constructs. The udev task requires special handling\nbecause it does not yield and because it contains a non-terminating loop.\nThe dbus tree\nThe dbus tree is a data structure which contains the state of the D-Bus\nlayers. Access to the dbus tree is controlled by a read/write lock.\nThe stratisd engine\nThe stratisd engine is the core of the stratisd daemon. It manages all the\nessential functionality of stratisd. Access to the engine is controlled\nby a mutex.\nThe dbus channel\nThe dbus channel is an unbounded multi-producer, single-consumer channel.\nIt carries messages instructing the DbusTreeHandler how to update the dbus\ntree. The DbusTreeHandler task is the unique consumer of the messages.\nThe DbusConnectionHandler, which processes D-Bus messages sent by the client,\nand the DbusUdevhandler, which handles udev events, may both place messages\non the dbus channel.\nThe udev channel\nThe udev channel is an unbounded multi-producer, single-consumer channel.\nIt carries messages about udev events to the DbusUdevHandler. There is\nonly one producer for this channel, the udev event handling task,\nwhich monitors udev events and places those events on the channel.\nsignal handling task\nThe signal handling task is a non-blocking task which waits for SIGINT. If\nit receives the signal it sets should_exit to true and finishes.\ndevice-mapper event task\nThe device-mapper event task loops forever waiting for a device-mapper event.\nOn receipt of any event, it locks the stratisd engine, and processes the\nevent. It yields when waiting for a new device-mapper event or when waiting\nfor a lock on the engine.\nudev event handling task\nThe udev event handling task uses a polling mechanism to detect udev events.\nIf a udev event is detected it places a message on the stratisd udev channel.\nIt reads should_exit after every udev event or, if no udev event has\noccurred, after a designated time interval. If  should_exit is true when\nread it returns immediately.\nD-Bus Tasks\nThe management of the D-Bus layer is handled by several cooperating tasks.\nThe dbus crate supplies one task, which detects D-Bus messages and places\nthem on its own unbounded channel. The stratisd tasks are the\nDbusTreeHandler task, the DbusConnectionHandler task, and the\nDbusUdevHandler task.\nDbusTreeHandler task\nstratisd defines a DbusTreehandler task which updates the dbus tree and\nmay also handle emitting D-Bus signals. It is the unique receiver on\nthe stratisd dbus channel and the only task which obtains a write lock\non the dbus tree. It is a non-blocking task.\nDbusConnectionHandler task\nstratisd defines a DbusConnectionHandler task which spawns a\nnew task for every D-Bus method call. Each spawned task obtains a read\nlock on the dbus tree before it begins to process the D-Bus method call,\nand may also lock the engine. If it locks the engine, it blocks on the lock.\nEach spawned task may place messages on the stratisd dbus channel. Each\ntask is responsible for sending replies to its D-Bus message on the D-Bus.\nThis is the only part of the implementation where new tasks can be spawned\nduring stratisd's regular operation.\nDbusUdevHandler task\nstratisd defines a DbusUdevHandler task which removes udev event information\nfrom the stratisd udev channel, allows the engine to process it, and puts\nany messages that may be necessary as a result of the engine processing the\nudev event on the stratisd dbus channel. Currently, a udev event may result in\na pool being set up; when that happens an add message must be placed on the\ndbus channel for every filesystem or block device belonging to the pool,\nas well as an add message for the pool itself. The DbusUdevHandler locks\nthe engine when processing a udev event, but does not block on the lock.\nProperties and Consequences\nUnbounded Channels\nBoth the stratisd udev channel and the dbus channel are \"unbounded channels\".\nThese \"unbounded\" channels are actually bounded, but the bound on the number\nof messages allowed on the channel is the maximum value of the Rust usize type.\nIt is assumed that other machine limits will be encountered before the number\nof messages on the channel reaches that limit. Because both channels are\nunbounded, tasks do not block placing a message on the channel, sending\nalways succeeds.\nWe chose to make the dbus channel unbounded, as there exist two situations\nwhere a large number of messages may be placed on the channel. When a pool\nis constructed, the number of messages placed on the channel is proportional\nto the number of devices in the pool. On startup, when stratisd sets up\na pool from its constituent devices, the number of messages is proportional\nto the number of devices and to the number of filesystems that the pool\nsupports. We prefer to use an unbounded channel rather than to bound the\nnumber of filesystems by the channel size.\nGenerally speaking, we expect the number of messages on the channel, except\non the occasion of pool creation or setup, to be no greater than 1; no other\naction currently implemented requires more than one message to be sent to the\nDbusTreeHandler. Messages will be rapidly consumed by the DbusTreeHandler, as\nit is the only task that takes a write lock on the dbus tree, and a task\nwaiting for a write lock takes precedence over one waiting for a read lock.\nThe choice of unbounded channels also eliminates one possible source of\ndeadlock.\nBounded Number of Blocking Threads\nWe have accepted, at this time, the tokio default for the number of blocking\nthreads, which is 512. Because the DbusConnectionHandler's generated tasks\nare blocking, this places an upper bound on the number of\ndistinct D-Bus messages that can be handled concurrently. Note that it\nis quite possible for 512 D-Bus messages to be handled by just one thread,\nas each task may be run in sequence on a single thread if the tasks complete\nrapidly.\nWe do not believe that this restriction will prove important in practice.\nThe dbus crate's message channel is unbounded, so D-Bus messages can not be\ndropped although they may be handled very slowly if there is a backlog.\nDepending on the client's configuration, this may cause the client to hang\nindefinitely waiting for a response or the client may receive a message\nindicating that no response was transmitted in the allotted time. However,\nthis situation can only arise if many messages require long-running actions\nto be taken and if these messages are sent in parallel.\nIn any case, the improvement with respect to a single-threaded approach is\nobvious. In the existing single threaded design, stratisd would be\nunable to handle any other events until all the D-Bus messages had been\nhandled. With the multi-threaded design, udev and device-mapper events can\nbe handled when they arrive, interspersed with the handling of the D-Bus\nmessages.\nOne Task per D-Bus Message Model\nIn the single-threaded design, every D-Bus message is handled completely\nbefore handling of the next D-Bus message is begun. In our multi-threaded\ndesign multiple D-Bus message handling tasks may be being processed at the same\ntime if the tokio scheduler allocates two message handling tasks to separate\nthreads.\nEach such task must:\n\nAcquire a read lock on the dbus tree.\nQuery the tree in order to find the necessary information to call the engine\nmethod.\nEnter a mutex on the stratisd engine.\nOperate on the stratisd engine.\nPlace any required messages on the dbus channel.\nExit the mutex.\nRelinquish the read lock.\n\nWhile processing of each message will be started precisely in the sequence\nin which the messages arrive, the order in which messages complete may not\nbe the same, because a later task may enter the engine mutex before an earlier\ntask.\nThe motivation for this design is obvious, although the benefits are not\nyet realized in this preliminary multi-threading implementation. In future,\nwe expect to relax the requirement that each task have exclusive access to\nthe entire engine and lock only the relevant parts of the engine. With that\nextension two non-interfering D-Bus commands may be run separately. The\nsame general advantage from this proposed enhancement will also be gained\nin the matter of, for example, handling device-mapper events while\nsimultaneously handling a D-Bus method.\nThis change introduces a relaxation of certain properties that held in\nthe single-threaded case.\n\n\nIf a D-Bus method that mutates state and requires an update to the\ndbus tree is invoked the changes to the dbus tree resulting from that method\ncall are not visible until some time after the call has returned as updates\nto the dbus tree can only occur after the method has completed. This can\nbe observed by a client, if the client invokes a second method immediately\nafter the first has returned. For example, if the client invokes the CreatePool\nmethod and then immediately invokes the GetManagedObjects() method, some\npool object paths corresponding to the pool or its devices may not yet\nbe present in the tree. The opposite behavior can also be observed, for\nexample, if the client invokes the DestroyPool method, some object paths\nbelonging to the destroyed pool may still be found by a GetManagedObjects()\ninvocation.\n\n\nIf two D-Bus methods are invoked in separate processes, the same behaviors\ndescribed in (1) are somewhat easier to observe.\n\n\nWe believe that we have made it impossible to incorrectly update the\ntree by returning rich result types from the engine methods.\n\n\nGiven two distinct mutating D-Bus methods running in separate threads\nthere is a possibility of a situation rather analogous to a race-condition\narising. Two tasks may read the dbus tree, update the internal engine state,\nand then send update messages on the dbus channel. It is uncertain which\ntask will acquire the engine mutex. This is\npartially analogous to the classic race-condition where two processes read a\nsingle variable, and then both update that variable in an undetermined order.\nWhat makes this analogy only partial is the interposition of the engine,\nwhich restricts the updates that may be requested of the DbusTreeHandler by\nthe DbusRequestHandler. The engine methods invoked by the D-Bus layer return\na result which sufficiently distinguishes the actions actually taken by\nthe engine so that conflicting updates to the dbus tree can not be\nrequested. Thus the updates are constrained to be correct.\nFor example, consider that two conflicting commands may be handled at the\nsame time: one command to delete a filesystem and the other to rename\nthe same filesystem. If both commands are being handled in separate threads\neach will read the same data based on the filesystem object. Then, either\none may enter the engine mutex. If the rename task enters the mutex first,\nit will be the first to place a message on the dbus channel. The DbusTreeHandler\nwill remove the rename message first and then the remove message placed\non the dbus channel after the remove request completes. Clearly,\nthis order of processing can not result in an error. With the other order,\nthe remove message will be placed on the dbus channel before the rename\noccurs. But in this case, the engine method will return a result indicating\nthat no rename could occur, because the filesystem could not be found.\nConsequently, no rename message will be put on the dbus channel, and so the\nDbusTreeHandler will receive the remove message only. Thus, no incorrect\nupdate is performed on the dbus tree.\nError Behavior\nstratisd exits if any task returns an error, using the same mechanism\nand general procedure that it uses on receipt of SIGINT. Causes of error\nmay include:\n\nan error when polling for udev events\nan error when polling for device-mapper events\nfailure to properly set up a D-Bus connection on startup\nan error when consuming a message on one of the stratisd channels\n\nA properly handled error within the stratisd engine will not\nresult in the termination of any tasks. In the case of a D-Bus method call,\nfor example, an error result is interpreted by the D-Bus layer, and some\nrepresentation of that error is then incorporated into the message returned\non the D-Bus.\nWe have taken great care to avoid panics within stratisd. Nonetheless,\nit is reasonable to discuss possible behavior on any panic which may\noccur.\nIf one of the dynamically spawned DbusTreeHandler tasks experiences a panic\nwhile executing, stratisd will not be terminated. Only the currently running\ntask will fail to complete.  When a new D-Bus message is received, a new task\nwill be spawned and will execute as usual.\nHowever, a panic that occurs during the execution of a task like the\nudev event handling task, of which there is only one spawned when\nstratisd is started, will cause stratisd to exit.\nEnsuring a Clean and Prompt Exit\nOn SIGINT, stratisd should exit promptly and cleanly. This is ensured by:\n\nHaving a separate signal handling task that waits on SIGINT. The tokio\nscheduler will ensure that this task is run regularly; thus the signal\ncan not be ignored. Note that in the single-threaded case it is possible\nfor the signal handling code never to be reached.\nCausing asynchronous tasks to terminate at their next synchronization point\nwhen the signal handling task terminates.\nHaving the udev event handling loop check the flag set by the signal\nhandling task on every iteration, and terminate if the flag\nis true.\nEach distinct D-Bus method processing task is allowed to run to completion,\nso that every action that it has begun can be completed.\n\nStatistics\nUsing tokio increases the size of the stratisd executable by about 1 MiB,\nwhich at stratisd's current size is an increase of approximately 20%.\nRemarks\nPreliminary multi-threading support will be included in the next stratisd\nrelease, 2.4.0.\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/multi-threading/","title":"Multi-threading Support in stratisd"},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/per-pool-locking/":{"body":"John Baublitz, Stratis Team\nOverview\nRecently, we've merged a PR that completes our work on improved concurrency in\nstratisd.  Previously, we had made some changes to the IPC layer to provide the\nability for stratisd to handle incoming requests in parallel which you can read\nabout here. This work allowed IPC requests to each be handled\nin a separate tokio task, but the Stratis engine, the part of our code that\nhandles all of the storage stack operations, could still only be accessed\nsequentially.\nMotivation\nAfter having conversations with the LVM team, it seemed like sequential accesses\nof storage operations was not entirely necessary. While modifying multiple layers\nof the pool stack at once can cause problems, modifying independent pools in\nparallel is safe, and we wanted to take advantage of the potential for increased\nconcurrency. A large part of this is due to how we handle D-Bus properties. Our\nD-Bus properties expose aspects of the storage stack that sometimes require\nquerying the device-mapper stack for information. With sequential accesses,\nthis would mean that even two list operations on any two pools could not run in\nparallel, a restriction that causes a bad user experience and is not technically\nnecessary.\nRequirements\nDespite the motivation being clear, the solution turned out to be more complicated.\nOne of the major problems that we bumped into when trying to achieve more granular\nconcurrency was the interaction between standard Rust synchronization structures\nand the API for listing D-Bus objects.\nOur initial idea was to wrap the data structure containing the record of all of\nthe pools in a read-write lock. This had a few notable drawbacks. For one, you\ncould not acquire mutable access to two independent pools at a time even though\nthis is a completely safe operation.\nThis led us to the idea of wrapping each pool in a read-write lock. Unfortunately,\nthis also had some major drawbacks. One notable example of this was the behavior of\nour list operation with this solution. A list operation would require a read lock\non every single pool and this means that the time that it would take to list all of\nthe pools or filesystems would increase proportionally with the number of pools\non the system. Because locking is relatively expensive, we noticed a significant\nslowdown when listing larger numbers of pools and filesystems.\nOur ideal scenario was to have the benefits of a read-write lock so that list\noperations could run in parallel but to provide an ability to either lock single\npools or all pools in one operation so that locking all pools would take the\nsame amount of time no matter how many were present on the system.\nDesign\nAfter determining that no locking data structure like this appeared to exist\nin tokio, we took some time to look into how tokio implements its locking data\nstructures. The API for much of the locking data structures appeared to\nbe a lock acquisition method that returned a future. This future would poll the state\nof the lock and either update the internal data structures to indicate that\nthe lock had been acquired or put itself to sleep until it was ready to poll\nagain. The drop method on the data structure returned by the future would\ntrigger waking up a task to poll again. This seemed perfectly workable with\na more granular read-write lock. The only difference would be that we would\nneed to keep track of locks on individual pools as well as locks on the entire\ncollection. The proper locking conflict rules would need to be checked:\n\nWriteAll conflicts with all other operations.\nReadAll conflicts with WriteAll and Write on any pool.\nWrite conflicts with WriteAll and Read or Write on the same pool.\nRead conflicts with WriteAll and Write on the same pool.\n\nAny attempt to acquire two conflicting locks would queue one of the tasks to\nbe woken up once the conflicting lock was dropped.\nNotable design choices\nWe chose to implement our lock as a starvation-free lock. Implementing a lock\nthat allows ReadAll to bypass Write* requests that are queued when another\nReadAll request has already acquired the lock leads to behavior where Write*\nrequests could block indefinitely. This behavior could cause list operations to\nblock filesystem extension handling indefinitely, potentially leading to IO errors\nand a full filesystem. A starvation-free locking approach puts a task in a FIFO\nqueue if any are already queued in front of it. The notable downside of this is\nslightly more latency for handling locking requests, but the benefits seemed to\noutweigh this.\nBecause tokio can cause spurious wake ups for tasks, we assign a unique integer\nID to each future responsible for polling the lock for readiness. In the case\nwhere there is both a legitimate and spurious wake up at the same time, this\nallows our lock to differentiate between the two woken tasks to determine which\none should be given priority and which should be put to sleep. This prevents\nspurious wake ups from acquiring the lock before they are scheduled to.\nBecause tokio does not currently allow lifetimes shorter than 'static when\npassing a reference across thread boundaries, our locking data structure\nheavily uses automatic reference counting (Arc). This enables shared access\nbetween multiple threads and the ability to pass an acquired lock handle to\na separate thread after acquisition. Without the use of Arc, the pool would\nhave to be operated on in the same task as the lock acquisition which would\nprevent passing lock handles to separate tasks to process them in parallel.\nOptimizations\nAfter our initial implementation of the write-all lock, we bumped into an issue\nwhere we could not pass all pool lock handles into separate threads to handle\nthem all in parallel. This was particularly problematic for our implementation\nof background devicemapper event handling. Our solution for this was to allow\nacquiring all locks at once to avoid the penalty of locking each pool individually\nand then converting that lock handle to a set of individual locks that can all\nbe released when they are no longer needed. This addressed both the issue of\nparallelization and constant time locking for all pools nicely.\nOriginally we also only woke one queued task at a time when a lock was released.\nThis proved to be less performant. If two ReadAll tasks were queued, these could\nboth be woken up in parallel and acquire the lock with no conflict. The solution\nto this was to factor out the part of the code that tests for conflicts and traverse\nthe queue and wake up all tasks until a conflicting task is found. This allowed\nwaking up a batch of queued tasks that could all operate in parallel without\nalso waking up a conflicting task that would immediately be put back to sleep.\nFuture work\nRecently, we discovered that we should be able to provide even more\nparallelization for filesystem background operations. While we cannot perform\nmultiple pool mutation operations in parallel, the filesystems on top of the\npool can be modified independently in parallel. We expect to change the way\nbackground checks on filesystem usage are handled by spawning each filesystem\nextension in its own tokio task so that, for pools with many filesystems, the\nfilesystem extension will be more responsive. Rather than iterating through\nhundreds of filesystems, stratisd will be able to handle multiple filesystem\nextensions in parallel, speeding up the checking process if there is more than\none filesystem that needs to be extended at once. This will benefit IO performance\nby ensuring that the filesystems are extended in a timely manner to avoid cases\nwhere the filesystem is filled before it can be extended.\nFinal notes\nWe've added extensive debugging for the locking data structure in case users run\ninto issues. To enable these logs and see the state of the per-pool locking data\nstructure over time, simply enable trace logs in stratisd!\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/per-pool-locking/","title":"Addition of per-pool locking"},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratify/":{"body":"Bryn Reeves, Stratis team\nSupport for using Stratis as the root filesystem was added in version 2.4.0 but\nwithout support in distribution installers it can be tricky for users to build\nsystems for testing.\nThis blog post will look at a quick method for installing systems with Stratis\nas the root filesystem using the Fedora Live ISO, kickstart, and a Python script to\nsimplify and automate the process.\nBackground\nStratis has supported use as the root filesystem since version 2.4.0 and the steps\nrequired to prepare a system with Stratis as the root filesystem are conceptually\nstraightforward: allocate storage to a system and then create a Stratis pool and\nfilesystem, copy the desired installation content to the new filesystem and then set\nup a boot loader to boot the newly installed system.\nTypically these details would all be handled by an operating system installer such as\nFedora's Anaconda based on the parameters specified by the user. That's fine if the\ninstaller knows about the filesystem type you are using, but testing new filesystems\ntypically requires a more manual approach. For Stratis the following steps are\nneeded:\n\nPartition disks as required for EFI or BIOS boot\nInstall packages needed for Stratis\nCreate a Stratis pool and filesystem\nInstall packages into the new root filesystem\nInstall Grub2 or another bootloader on the installation disk\nGenerate an initramfs image with the required components\nConfigure the bootloader to boot the new system\n\nThis can be done manually but it is a long and tedious process with plenty of\nopportunity for mistakes to creep in. A single error in any of the above steps may\nlead to an unbootable system and user frustration.\nIntroducing stratify.py\nIn this post we'll look at using the stratify.py script to automate the\ninstallation of a virtual machine using Stratis as the root filesystem. The script\nautomates the preparation of the basic system layout and then runs Anaconda to\nperform the OS installation. Once the installer has done its work stratify.py will\nset up the boot loader and other details needed for a working system.\nSince Anaconda is used to carry out the OS installation we will use a kickstart\nfile to configure the installed\nsystem.\nRefer to the stratify documentation for more\ndetails or press on to get started right away!\nRequirements\nIn order to install a system with Stratis as the root filesystem you will need an\nx86_64 virtual machine configured with the following specification:\n\nAt least 3GiB memory\nBIOS or UEFI firmware\nOne 10GiB or larger VirtIO disk for the installation\nThe Fedora LiveCD media (Fedora 37 or 38)\n\nGetting started\nConfigure the machine with your preferred virtualization solution and then boot the\nLive desktop environment.

See the kickstart\ndocumentation for further\ninformation.\nThe kickstart file sets the root account password to \"changeme\" - edit the file\nto set a new password, or use the openssl command to generate an encrypted\n(hashed) password:\n$ openssl passwd -6 \"newpassword\"\n$6$ly/YwB6/b5R6Pezz$zZGzBKgkPZvYHtefBwC7gJKB0BpW7ANJyt0sfjIf46yKS2IGfcnhfFW6wiXJLpYeQXvIBlJG/W7wukX0/S9Wu/\n\nIn ks.cfg:\n# Root password\nrootpw --iscrypted $6$ly/YwB6/b5R6Pezz$zZGzBKgkPZvYHtefBwC7gJKB0BpW7ANJyt0sfjIf46yKS2IGfcnhfFW6wiXJLpYeQXvIBlJG/W7wukX0/S9Wu/\n\nRunning the script\nOnce the stratify.py script and kickstart file have been downloaded, start\nthe installation process by running:\npython stratify.py --target vda --kickstart /root/ks.cfg\n\nThis will install required packages in the Live environment, set up the Stratis root\npool and filesystem, and run anaconda to perform the installation. The process logs\nto the terminal and to a file named stratify.log.\nTo encrypt the pool with a passphrase add --encrypt to the command line - you will\nbe prompted for the pool password when it is set up.\nThe installation should take less than 20 minutes with a typical network and virtual\nmachine configuration.\nWhen finished the script will print:\nINFO - Stratis root fs installation complete.\n\nAt that point the machine is ready to reboot into the Stratis root filesystem.

To achieve this, Stratis prioritizes a straightforward\ncommand-line experience, a rich API, and a fully automated approach to storage\nmanagement. It builds upon elements of the existing storage stack as much as\npossible.  Specifically, Stratis uses device-mapper, LUKS, XFS, and Clevis.\nStratis may also incorporate additional technologies in the future.\n\nStratis can configure an encrypted or unencrypted pool of storage with one or\nmore file systems quickly and without prior knowledge of the many storage\nlayers and commands.\nLinux has a number of storage technologies that provide advanced functionality\nto applications for accessing and storing data.  Examples of some of these\nproducts that Stratis uses are:\n\ndevice-mapper - A framework for logical to physical mapping of data blocks\nLUKS          - An on disk format for encryption that can securely manages\nmultiple passwords\nXFS           - A scalable, journaling, and performant filesystem\nClevis        - A framework for automated decryption\n\nLearning and gaining experience in a number of different storage technologies\ncan take many years.  Each of those technologies may have their own unique\ncommand-line syntax, APIs, options, and logging.  Stratis simplifies volume\nand filesystem management by providing a single CLI and API for users to set up\ncomplex storage stacks without having to spend time learning each independent\nstorage technology.\nCLI Example\nThe simplicity that Stratis provides can be seen when comparing the CLI\ncommands used for creating a filesystem that encrypts data-at-rest, to the\nmethod an advanced user would use to configure each layer separately:\nStratis commands to create an encrypted pool and filesystem:\n&gt; stratis key set testkey --capture-key\n    &lt;enter passphrase&gt;\n&gt; stratis pool create p1 --key-desc testkey /dev/sdb\n&gt; stratis fs create p1 fs1\n\nCommands an advanced user would use to configure a similar filesystem: \n&gt; cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat /dev/sdb\n    &lt;enter \"YES\"&gt;\n    &lt;enter passphrase&gt;\n    &lt;verify passphrase&gt;\n&gt; cryptsetup -v luksOpen /dev/sdb luks-device\n&gt; pvcreate /dev/mapper/luks-device\n&gt; vgcreate vg1 /dev/mapper/luks-device\n&gt; lvcreate -L 100M -T vg1/athinpool\n&gt; lvcreate -V1G -T vg1/athinpool -n thinvolume\n&gt; mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/vg1-thinvolume\n\nAPI Example\nStratis has also built a D-Bus API for developers to implement the storage\nmanagement features directly into their project.

The\nchanges to the daemon are covered first, followed by the changes to the\nCLI.\nstratisd 2.0.0\nThis release makes the D-Bus API more robust, reliable, predictable, and\nextensible. There are several significant changes:\n\n\nThe set of D-Bus properties has been reduced to a core set of fundamental\nand stable properties. Other filesystem, pool, or block devices properties are\nnow obtainable via methods in the FetchProperties interface. This change\nincreases the robustness of the D-Bus interface to failures occurring in any\nparticular pool, filesystem, or block device, and decreases the computational\ncost of most operations requested by the Stratis CLI. Several properties,\nformerly returned as D-Bus properties, are now unavailable by means of the\nD-Bus. In every case, the reason for removing the property was that it did not\nrepresent a well-defined value. See project issue 52 for further details.\n\n\nAll D-Bus method calls are idempotent. This should make writing scripts\nusing the D-Bus API much simpler and make reasoning about the behavior\nof the engine more straightforward. Henceforth, we will treat as a bug any\nnon-idempotent behavior in the D-Bus API. See project issue 51 for further\ndetails.\n\n\nAll D-Bus size values are now returned in bytes. Again, this should make\nwriting scripts against the D-Bus more straightforward, since it will be\nunnecessary for the script writer to change their interpretation of the number\nreturned on the D-Bus depending on the value that it represents. See\nstratisd issue 1243 for further details.\n\n\nFuture enhancements to the D-Bus API will be implemented by means of\nadditional versioned interfaces.\nPlease consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.\nstratis-cli 2.0.0\nThis release requires stratisd 2.0.0. The user will observe the following\nsignificant improvements:\n\n\nThe CLI is significantly more robust. Previously, there was a category of\nerror conditions in pools, filesystems, and block devices that would make the\nCLI virtually unusable; this problem has now been entirely resolved. See\nproject issue 52 for further details.\n\n\nThe CLI now reports errors consistently in conditions where a human user\nwould generally expect an error to be reported. Previously, many commands in\nthe CLI were idempotent, to facilitate scripting. Now there is a clear\ndistinction between the CLI behavior and the stratisd D-Bus API behavior: the\nCLI behavior is designed strictly according to the expectations of a human\nuser, the stratisd D-Bus API is the programmable interface. See\nproject issue 51 for further details.\n\n\nAs always, anyone wishing to implement a program that uses Stratis for\nstorage management is strongly advised to make use of the stratisd D-Bus API\nrather than the CLI.\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-0-0/","title":"Stratis 2.0.0 Release Notes"},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-1-0/":{"body":"mulhern, Stratis Team\nStratis 2.1.0 introduces support for encryption.\nIt supports per-pool encryption of the devices that form a pool's data\ntier. A pool may be encrypted, or its constituent encrypted devices may\nbe activated, by means of a key stored in the kernel keyring.\nstratisd 2.1.0\nThis release implements encryption support and adds several new D-Bus\ninterfaces to administer or monitor that support.\nIt implements encryption support in the following way:\n\nA single instance of stratisd can support both encrypted and unencrypted\npools.\nThe choice to encrypt a pool must be made at the time a pool is created.\nAt present, the use of a cache and of encryption are mutually exclusive;\nif the pool is created with encryption enabled, then it is not possible\nto create a cache.\nEach pool may be encrypted by means of a key in the kernel keyring; each\nencrypted pool may make use of a different key, but all devices in a pool\nare encrypted with a single key.\nAny additional devices that are added to an encrypted pool's data tier\nwill be encrypted using the key that was specified when the pool was\ninitialized.\n\nstratisd 2.1.0 supplies several new D-Bus interfaces:\n\norg.storage.stratis2.manager.r1: This interface supplies an\nextended CreatePool method, to support an optional argument for\nencryption. In addition, it supplies a number of method for key\nmanagement.\norg.storage.stratis2.pool.r1: This interface supports explicit\ninitialization of a cache tier. Previously, a cache was initialized as\na side-effect of the addition of the first device to the cache tier.\nIt also supports the new Encrypted property.\norg.storage.stratis2.FetchProperties.r1: This interface supports an\nadditional HasCache property.\norg.storage.stratis2.Report.r1: This interface supports a set of\nad-hoc reports about Stratis. The interface is unstable; the names by\nwhich the reports can be accesed are not guaranteed to remain stable,\nand the format of any report is only guaranteed to be valid JSON.\n\nPlease consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.\nThe following are significant implementation details:\n\nEach block device in an encrypted pool's data tier is encrypted with a\ndistinct, randomly chosen MEK (Media Encryption Key) on initialization.\nAll devices belonging to a single encrypted pool share a single passphrase,\nsupplied via the kernel keyring.\nThe release requires cryptsetup version 2.3.\n\nWe would like to thank our external contributor GuillaumeGomez for further\nwork on metadata refactoring (stratisd issue 1573).\nstratis-cli 2.1.0\nThis release requires stratisd 2.1.0. The user will observe the following\nchanges:\n\nThe pool create command has been extended to allow encryption.\nThere is a new pool init_cache command, for initializing a cache.\nThere is a new subcommand, key, for key management tasks.\nThere is a new subcommand, report, which allows the display of certain\nreports generated by stratisd.\nThe output of pool list now includes a Properties column; each\nentry in the column is a string encoding the following properties of the\npool:\n\nwhether or not it has a cache\nwhether or not it is encrypted\n\n\n\nAll commands now verify that stratis is communicating with a compatible\nversion of stratisd and will fail with an appropriate error if stratisd is\nfound to have an incompatible version.\nUsage\nTo create an encrypted pool, a user must first ensure that a key is placed\nin the kernel keyring. We strongly encourage using the commands available\nvia the stratis key subcommand for this task. This key, which is secret,\nhas a corresponding key description, which is public.\nAn encrypted pool is then created by specifying the key description\nwhen using the pool create command.\nIt is necessary that the correct key and corresponding key description be set\nin the kernel keyring in order to set up a previously encrypted pool. Setting\nup a previously encrypted pool requires an explicit pool unlock command from\nthe user. This command will attempt to unlock the devices belonging to any\npreviously encrypted pool; it can only unlock all devices if a key for every\nencrypted pool is in the keyring. Once the devices belonging to a previously\nencrypted pool have been unlocked, the pool will be set up, and can be used in\nexactly the same manner as an unencrypted pool.\n\nPlease consult the changelogs for additional information about the release.\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-1-0/","title":"Stratis 2.1.0 Release Notes"},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-2-0/":{"body":"mulhern, Stratis Team\nStratis 2.2.0 now places Stratis filesystem symlinks in /dev/stratis,\nrather than /stratis.

The user may select either the \"tang\" mechanism, which implements\nNBDE (Network-bound Disc Encryption) by means of a Tang server, or the\n\"tpm2\" mechanism, which uses TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) encryption.\nBinding the devices in a pool to a supplementary Clevis encryption policy does\nnot remove the primary encryption mechanism, which uses a key in the kernel\nkeyring.\nThe pool unbind command simply unbinds a previously added encryption\npolicy from all the devices in the specified pool.\nIn the pool unlock command it is now necessary to specify the mechanism.\nUse clevis to make use of the Clevis unlocking policy previously\nspecified for the devices in the pool. Use keyring, to make use of the\nmechanism that uses a key in the kernel keyring, which was introduced\nin Stratis 2.1.0. Note that the pool unlock command unlocks all currently\nlocked pools.\nstratisd 2.3.0\nThis release introduces two D-Bus interface revisions, which differ in the\nfollowing way from the previous revisions.\norg.storage.stratis2.Manager.r3 modifies the UnlockPool method to take\nan additional parameter, unlock_method, which may be keyring or clevis.\norg.storage.stratis2.pool.r3 adds two new method: Bind and Unbind.\nThe Bind method takes two arguments, pin and json. The pin argument\ndesignates the Clevis pin as a string, and the json argument encodes\na Clevis configuration appropriate to the designated pin. The configuration\nis a JSON object. Besides Clevis information, it may include Stratis-specific\nkeys that encode configuration decisions that Stratis may implement. At\npresent there is just one such key: stratis:tang:trust_url.\nThe Unbind method reverses a Bind action.\nRemarks\nThe Bind method may be called with any Clevis pin and configuration;\nwe expect that any valid Clevis pin and configuration can be used to bind the\ndevices in a pool. However the Stratis project officially supports only the\n\"tang\" and \"tpm2\" pins as those are the pins that may be designated via\nstratis. Support for additional Clevis policies may be introduced into\nstratis in later releases.\nWhen binding a supplementary encryption policy to the devices in a pool\nusing Clevis, the primary key, which is the key in the kernel keyring which\nwas originally used to encrypt each device, must be supplied. stratisd\nobtains the appropriate key from the kernel keyring in order to provide it\nto the Clevis binding mechanism. The correct key must be present in the\nkeyring for the bind operation to succeed. It is not necessary for the user\nto specify the key, stratisd obtains the necessary information from the\nLUKS2 metadata on the devices in the pool.\nIn general, it is unwise to write a key consisting of arbitrary binary data\nto a keyfile. An accidental newline character in the data may cause the\ncontents of the file to be truncated at the newline when read in one context\nwhile all the data may be read from the file in some other context.\nWe are not aware that such a mistake would result in any error in Stratis's\noperation when Stratis is used in the way that we recommend. We explicitly\nacknowledge that it might be possible, through some direct interaction with\nthe stratisd D-Bus API, or by, e.g., setting a key in the kernel keyring\nwithout using stratis, to manufacture a situation where stratisd could not\nbind the devices in a pool, even when the correct key is set in the kernel\nkeyring.

The pool\nlisting includes an Alerts column. Currently this column is used to indicate\nwhether the pool is in a restricted operation mode. A new subcommand,\nstratis pool explain, which provides a fuller explanation of the codes\ndisplayed in the Alerts column has been added.  The filesystem listing\nnow displays a filesystem's logical size.\nWith encrypted pools it was previously possible for the display of block\ndevice paths to change format if stratisd was restarted after an encrypted\npool had been created. Now the display of the block device paths is consistent\nacross stratisd restarts.\n\nIn stratisd 3.0.0 the D-Bus API has undergone a revision and the prior\ninterfaces are all removed. The FetchProperties interfaces that\nwere supported by all objects have been removed. The values that were\npreviously obtainable via the FetchProperties methods\nare now conventional D-Bus properties. The possible values of error codes\nreturned by the D-Bus methods have been reduced to 0 and 1, with the usual\ninterpretation.\nstratisd 3.0.0 includes a number of significant internal improvements and a few\nbug fixes.\nstratisd bug fixes:\n\nPreviously the Stratis release included a dracut.conf.d file which made\nthe Stratis dracut modules required in the initramfs. The consequence of this\nwas that the initramfs could not be built unless all files required for the\nStratis modules were present; if the initramfs is not built a reboot will fail.\nThat file has been removed in this release.\nThe --prompt option was not passed to stratis-min in the\nstratis-fstab-setup script; this prevented the user from entering the\npassword necessary to unlock an encrypted pool during boot. This is\nno longer the case.\nPreviously, stratisd did not increase the amount of space allocated to\nits spare metadata device when its in-use thinpool metadata device was\nextended. In some situations, when setting up a pool, stratisd might attempt\na repair operation on the thinpool metadata device; if the space allocated\nfor the spare metadata device was not large enough to accommodate all the\nmetadata, then the repair operation would fail. Now the space allocated for\nthe spare metadata device is increased whenever the metadata device is extended.\nstratisd was not immediately updating the devicemapper device stack when\na cache was initialized with the result that the cache was not immediately\nput in use. This is no longer the case.\nstratisd was not immediately updating the Clevis encryption info associated\nwith a pool on a command to bind an encrypted pool with Clevis. This problem\nhas been corrected.\nstratisd was sending an incorrect D-Bus signal on a pool name change; this\nhas been fixed.\nPreviously, when stratisd-min, which runs during boot before D-Bus\nfunctionality is available, gave way to stratisd when the D-Bus had been set\nup, it was possible for inconsistencies to arise if the Stratis engine was\nperforming an operation which required invoking a distinct executable. The\nexecutable might be terminated during its execution, and stratisd-min would\ntake the action appropriate to the command failure before exiting. Now, systemd\nis instructed to send a kill signal only to stratisd-min and not to any of\nstratisd-min's child processes when shutting down stratisd-min.\nPreviously, if the same device was specified using two different paths\nwhen creating or extending a pool the different paths would be\ninterpreted as two different devices and an error would be returned when\nstratisd attempted to initialize the device a second time. Now, the\ndifferent paths are canonicalized eagerly, and converted into a single\ncanonical representation of the device, stratisd initializes the device only\nonce, and no error is returned.\nPreviously, stratisd did not report all existing object paths in the\nresult of a D-Bus Introspect() call. This was due to a bug in version\n0.9.1 and previous of stratisd's dbus-tree dependency. stratisd now\nrequires dbus-tree 0.9.2, so all nodes are reported.\n\nOther stratisd improvements:\n\nPreviously, stratisd relied entirely on udev information when deciding\nwhether a storage device was not in use by another application and could\nsafely be overwritten with Stratis metadata. Now it performs a supplementary\ncheck using libblkid and exits with an error if libblkid reports that the\ndevice is in use.\nHandling of errors returned by internal methods is improved; a chaining\nmechanism has been introduced and the error chains can be scrutinized\nprogramatically to identify expected scenarios like rollback failures.\nA set of states indicating that a pool has reduced capability have been\nadded internally and are published on the D-Bus. A pool's capability is\nreduced on an error being returned internally which contains, somewhere in\nits chain, the appropriate identifying error variant.\nThe code used to roll back failed encryption operations on a list of\npool devices has been refactored and generalized. It is now capable of\nreturning an error that can be used to identify a restricted pool capability\ndue to a rollback failure.\nstratisd uses sha-256 instead of sha-1 for Clevis-related encryption\noperations to conform with Clevis's own usage.\nstratisd exits more elegantly and less frequently if it encounters an\nerror during execution of the distinct tasks that are assigned to the\nindividual threads that it manages internally.\nIn preparation for edition 2021 of the Rust language, stratisd source code\nhas been updated to conform entirely to edition 2018 recommendations.\n\n\nNOTE: stratisd depends directly on the chrono crate against which\nRUSTSEC-2020-0159 has been filed. We have demonstrated that stratisd is\nnot affected by this CVE by building and testing stratisd against a\nclone of the chrono crate from which all the code affected by the CVE\nhas been removed, proving that stratisd has no dependency on that code.\nPlease consult the stratisd and stratis-cli changelogs for additional\ninformation about the 3.0.0 release.\nWe would like to thank mvollmer for contributions to this release.\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-0-0/","title":"Stratis 3.0.0 Release Notes"},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-1-0/":{"body":"mulhern, Stratis Team\nStratis 3.1.0 includes significant improvements to the management of the\nthin-provisioning layers, as well as a number of other user-visible\nenhancements and bug fixes.\nPlease see this post for a detailed discussion of the thin-provisioning\nchanges.

It is a pool destroy operation\nwithout the final step of wiping the Stratis metadata. Starting a pool is\nsetting up a pool according to the information stored in the pool level\nmetadata of the devices associated with a pool. Whether a pool is stopped or\nstarted is stored in the pool-level metadata, with the consequence that users\ncan control whether a pool is automatically started when stratisd is started\nup, or whether startup of the pool is deferred until explicitly requested.\nstratis supports these changes with new commands to start and to stop a\npool.

It is a\nprerequisite.\nFor a little bit of background, stratisd provides an additional subpackage for our dracut modules that we\nuse to set up the root filesystem during early boot. This package installs the necessary modules for dracut\nto automate the setup. However there are some steps that may not be obvious to users to get this all to work.\nWe'll cover them below.\nSteps:\n\nInstall the stratisd-dracut package.

D-Bus does not currently ship in the initramfs so the first order of business\nwas to choose an alternate form of IPC. Because we require the ability to pass a file\ndescriptor from the client to the daemon, this made Unix sockets the only reasonable\ntransport mechanism. After evaluating several JSON RPC libraries with Unix socket\nsupport, we decided to write a minimal RPC interface ourselves. This was due to a\nfew constraints:\n\nJSON RPC libraries with Unix socket support did not support setting the ancillary\ndata for packets required to send file descriptors.\nThe libraries had relatively complicated threading models, and we preferred to take\na simple approach of processing each new request using a Tokio task.\nIt was relatively trivial to serialize full data structures as JSON thanks to\n[serde_json].\n\nThis approach proved successful and we were able to implement an IPC mechanism\nthat left our internal stratisd API unchanged. The alternate IPC mechanism is\ndistributed in a separate pair of executables, stratis-min and stratisd-min.\nSupport in the initramfs\nThe next step was to integrate stratisd-min into the initramfs. This involved quite a\nbit of configuration for dracut and systemd.\nOur current model uses systemd generators that are enabled by passing information on\nthe kernel command line at boot to properly set up and unlock any devices that need\nto be unlocked. We aim to do this in as user-friendly of a way as possible by\nleveraging existing tools like Plymouth to handle prompting users for a passphrase\non the splash screen.\nTo set up the generators and necessary dependencies, we wrote two dracut modules:\nstratis and stratis-clevis. stratis-clevis depends on stratis and is required for\nautomated unlocking using clevis.\nThe required information on the kernel command line is:\n\n root=[STRATIS_FS_SYMLINK]: The symlink under /dev/stratis that corresponds to\nthe desired Stratis filesystem. This is required by dracut.\n stratis.rootfs.pool_uuid=[POOL_UUID]: The UUID of the pool that contains the\nroot filesystem.\n\nIf the user requires networking (for example, unlocking a pool using Tang), the\nparameter rd.neednet=1 is required as well.\nTesting on Fedora using Anaconda\nThis process was relatively simple once it came time to test with Fedora. Anaconda\nprovides the parameter --dirinstall which allows the user to install into a path\nwith the mounted Stratis filesystem as the root directory. It requires a bit more\nconfiguration after the fact (manual /etc/fstab or .mount file configuration) but\nworks quite well.\n/etc/fstab or .mount files\nWe now also provide a systemd service to manage setting up non-root filesystems in\n/etc/fstab.  For devices that require a passphrase or are critical for a working\nsystem, the following line can be used:\n/dev/stratis/[STRATIS_SYMLINK] [MOUNT_POINT] xfs defaults,x-systemd.requires=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service,x-systemd.after=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service 0 2\nThe absence of nofail here is due to the fact that nofail causes the boot to\nproceed prior to a successful mount. This means that passphrase prompts\nwill not work properly, and most users will want critical system partitions to be\nmounted successfully or else have the boot fail.\nFor devices that do not require interaction to set up, such as unencrypted devices or\ndevices that have Clevis bindings, and are not critical for a working system, the\nfollowing line can be optionally used:\n/dev/stratis/[STRATIS_SYMLINK] [MOUNT_POINT] xfs defaults,x-systemd.requires=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service,x-systemd.after=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service,nofail 0 2\nThe addition of nofail here will cause mounting of this device to proceed\nindependently from the boot which can speed up boot times. The set up process will\ncontinue running in the background until it either succeeds or fails.\nBecause the root filesystem is mostly set up in the initramfs, the entry is slightly\ndifferent and does not require the stratis-fstab-setup service. It should be:\n/dev/stratis/[STRATIS_SYMLINK] / xfs defaults 0 1\nRecovery console\nWhile we mention above that stratisd could previously be used in the initramfs, there\nis one major caveat: it could be started but commands could not be issued. This had\none major drawback of not allowing users to interact with stratisd in the recovery\nconsole. D-Bus is not available in the recovery console, so the move to stratis-min\nand stratisd-min now allows users to perform recovery actions in the emergency console\nby starting stratisd-min and running the necessary commands using stratis-min. This\nwill make rescuing systems that do not boot significantly easier moving forward.\nScope of dracut modules and systemd service files\nWhile our dracut modules and systemd service files are meant to work for almost all\nusers, they may not meet the requirements of everyone using them. We encourage those\nwith more advanced configurations to design their own configurations and reach out\nfor guidance as needed. Our configuration is also meant as a template that you can\nbuild on!\nConclusion\nWhile this took quite a bit of effort to put all of the pieces together, the Linux\nboot utilities had all of the features we needed to accomplish this. We're excited\nfor future work with other teams to make using Stratis as the root filesystem\nfor Linux installations even easier!\nRelease version\nAll of the utilities required for booting from a Stratis filesystem as the root\nfilesystem will be included in stratisd 2.4.0.\nCorrections\n\nThe /etc/fstab examples previously omitted .service for stratis-fstab-setup. systemd\nassumes that any unit dependency in /etc/fstab is a .mount unit file unless explicitly\nspecified, so the examples as previously written would cause a failed boot unless nofail\nwas specified.\n\nFedora specific set up\nSee this guide for specific setup steps on Fedora.\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-rootfs/","title":"Stratis filesystems as the root filesystem"},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-1-0-6/":{"body":"mulhern, Stratis Team\nThis release includes one significant bug fix and a substantial refactoring.\nThe bug was caused by an inconsistency in the metadata handling which led to\na failure to properly update the Stratis metadata if stratisd was restarted\nin an environment where the system clock indicated a time earlier than when\nit had previously been running.

This package must be installed\nin order to support booting from a Stratis filesystem. All other\nfunctionality is included in the stratisd package.\nThe motivation for this change is to allow users greater flexibility and\nrobustness.

These users may choose to install only\nthe stratisd package.\nOther users may prefer to use a Stratis root filesystem.

Please consult\n[Stratis filesystem as the root filesystem] for further information about\nStratis support for a root filesystem.\nWe decided to implement this division due to a problem which would ensue\nif stratisd was installed but plymouth was not.

After gathering a lot of feedback on our thin\nprovisioning layer, we put together a proposal for improvements to how we currently handle\nallocations.\nThe changes can largely be divided up into three areas of improvement:\n\nPredictability\nSafety\nReliability\n\nPredictability\nWe made two notable changes to make behavior in the thin provisioning layer well-defined and\npredictable for users. Both parts relate to an existing thin provisioning tool,\nthin_metadata_size. This tool allows users to calculate the amount of metadata needed for\na thin pool with a given size and number of thin devices (filesystems and snapshots in the\ncase of stratisd). We have started taking advantage of thin_metadata_size to make our\nmetadata space reservation more precise. Instead of our previous approach of allocating\na fixed fraction of the available space, we now calculate the exact amount of space required for\na given pool size and number of filesystems and snapshots. The second change is a switch\nto lazy allocation. Previously, we allocated greedily which meant that every time a device\nwas added, we would allocate a certain amount of space for data and metadata regardless of\nthe individual user's requirements. We now delay allocation and allocate block device storage\non an as-needed basis allowing users to develop different requirements and adjust accordingly.\nFor example, a user may realize that they need more filesystems than they originally planned for.\nWith lazy allocation, assuming there is unallocated space on the pool, the user can now redirect\nthat unallocated space from data to metadata space so there is enough room for a greater\nnumber of filesystems than was originally anticipated.\nThis change resulted in two API modifications. One is filesystem limits; to appropriately\nensure that we never exceed the allocated metadata limit, we set a filesystem limit per\npool. This limit can be increased through the API, triggering a new allocation for\nmetadata space. The other API change is related to the switch to lazy allocation. There\nis now information available that reports the amount of space that has been allocated.\nPreviously we only concerned ourselves with used and total space, but with lazy allocation,\nit is now also important to report space that has been allocated but may not be in use yet.\nSafety\nA key drawback of thin provisioning is often the failure cases. When overprovisioning a\nstorage stack, the stack can get into a bad state when the pool becomes full due to the\nfilesystem being far larger than the pool backing it. We have added in two safety features\nto help users cope with this.\nOne measure is the addition of a mode to disable overprovisioning. This ensures that the size\nof all filesystems on the pool does not exceed the available physical storage provided by the\npool. This feature is not necessarily useful for all users, particularly with heavy snapshot\nusage because even if storage is shared between a snapshot and a filesystem, this mode will\ntreat them as entirely independent entities in terms of storage cost. This ensures that copy-\non-write operations will not accidentally fill the pool if the shared storage diverges between\nthe two, but puts a rather strict limit on snapshot capacity. For users that use Stratis for\ncritical applications or the root filesystem, this mode prevents certain failure cases that\ncan be challenging to recover from.\nWhen overprovisioning is enabled, we have also introduced a new API signal to notify the user\nwhen physical storage has been fully allocated. This does not necessarily mean that the pool\nhas run out of space but serves as a warning to the user that once the remaining free space\nfills up, Stratis has no space left to extend to. This gives users time to provide more storage\nfrom which to allocate space before reaching a failure case.\nReliability\nFor a while, we've gotten bug reports about the reliability of filesystem extension. In certain\ncases, Stratis was not able to handle filesystem extension smoothly or at all. Between the\nper-pool locking and the thin provisioning redesign, we have now resolved some of the\nprevious issues with filesystem extension. The approach we've taken attacks the problem from\na few different angles.\nEarlier filesystem extension\nStratis used to wait until several gigabytes were left to extend the filesystem. If Stratis didn't\nresize the filesystem quickly enough, the filesystem would run out of space before the extension\ncould complete. While this would eventually resolve itself once the filesystem was extended,\nit would cause some unnecessary IO errors. We now extend the filesystem at 50% usage\nto ensure that users always have a large buffer of free space available for even very IO-heavy\nusage patterns.\nParallelized filesystem extension operations\nStratis could previously only iterate sequentially through pools. Now stratisd can handle filesystem\nextension on two separate pools in parallel, reducing the latency between the point where\nhigh usage is detected and the extension operation being performed.\nPeriodic checks for filesystem usage\nChecking filesystem usage used to be a devicemapper event-dependent operation. This led to\nsome problems around filesystem extension. A devicemapper event would be generated periodically\nas the filesystem filled up, but if the filesystem failed to extend a few times,\ndevicemapper events would no longer be generated once the pool filled up and users would be\nleft with a filesystem that couldn't be extended. We've removed our dependency on devicemapper\nevents for filesystem monitoring and use devicemapper events for pool handling exclusively.\nInstead, we run periodic checks in the background on filesystems to ensure that even if\nfilesystem extension fails multiple times, once the filesystem is ready to be extended,\nstratisd can perform the operation in the background, so that we don't leave users in a state\nwhere their filesystem can't be extended.\nMigration and backwards compatibility\nThere are two types of changes that require migrations from older versions of stratisd: \nmetadata changes and allocation scheme changes.\nMetadata changes\nThe changes we made required some schema changes in our MDA, the metadata region outside of\nthe superblock that records longer form JSON about the specifics of the pool topology. The\nmigration should be invisible to the user and will be performed the first time the new\nversion of stratisd detects legacy pools. The migration adds some additional devicemapper\ninformation, information about filesystem limits on a pool, and other bookkeeping information.\nAllocation scheme changes\nAs mentioned above, the previous metadata allocation scheme was less precise and allocated\na larger segment for metadata space than was necessary for the amount of data space present.\nMigration for old pools will cause stratisd to detect that the metadata device is already larger\nthan it needs to be and no additional metadata device growth will occur until the data device\nsize becomes large enough to require additional metadata space.\nFuture work\nWe hope to eventually provide some smarter allocation strategies for our data and metadata\nallocations to maximize contiguous allocation extents.\n","id":"https://stratis-storage.github.io/thin-provisioning-redesign/","title":"Thin provisioning redesign"}},"docInfo":{"https://stratis-storage.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/cryptsetup/":{"body":90,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/multi-threading/":{"body":1858,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/per-pool-locking/":{"body":741,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratify/":{"body":587,"title":5},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-cli-release-notes-1-1-0/":{"body":111,"title":5},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-cli-release-notes-2-0-1/":{"body":81,"title":5},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-cli-release-notes-2-1-1/":{"body":45,"title":5},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-intro/":{"body":370,"title":2},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-announce-3-0-0/":{"body":153,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-0-5/":{"body":172,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-1-0-0/":{"body":186,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-0-0/":{"body":294,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-1-0/":{"body":409,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-2-0/":{"body":291,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-2-1/":{"body":69,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-3-0/":{"body":362,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-4-0/":{"body":209,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-4-1/":{"body":171,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-2-4-2/":{"body":40,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-0-0/":{"body":604,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-1-0/":{"body":149,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-2-0/":{"body":191,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-3-0/":{"body":179,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-4-0/":{"body":97,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-5-0/":{"body":152,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-release-notes-3-6-0/":{"body":233,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-rootfs-fedora/":{"body":108,"title":5},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-rootfs/":{"body":584,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-1-0-6/":{"body":100,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-2-0-1/":{"body":74,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-3-0-3/":{"body":55,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-3-0-4/":{"body":60,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-3-5-2/":{"body":100,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-3-5-8/":{"body":69,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-release-notes-3-6-4/":{"body":118,"title":4},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratisd-rootfs-packaging/":{"body":222,"title":3},"https://stratis-storage.github.io/thin-provisioning-redesign/":{"body":698,"title":3}},"length":38},"lang":"English"};
