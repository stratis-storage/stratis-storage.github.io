<h3 id="stratis-description">Stratis Description</h3>
<p>Stratis is a tool to easily configure pools and filesystems with enhanced
storage functionality that works within the existing Linux storage
management stack.  To achieve this, Stratis prioritizes a straightforward
command-line experience, a rich API, and a fully automated approach to storage
management. It builds upon elements of the existing storage stack as much as
possible.  Specifically, Stratis uses device-mapper, LUKS, XFS, and Clevis.
Stratis may also incorporate additional technologies in the future.</p>

<p>This post includes release notes for the prior patch releases in this
minor release.</p>
<p><code>stratisd</code> 3.6.4 includes a fix for <code>stratisd-min</code> handling of the start
command sent by <code>stratis-min</code> to unencrypted pools. It also captures and logs
errors messages emitted by the <code>thin_check</code> or <code>mkfs.xfs</code> executables.</p>
<p><code>stratisd</code> 3.6.3 explicitly sets the <code>nrext64</code> option to 0 when invoking
<code>mkfs.xfs</code>. A recent version of XFS changed the default for <code>nrext64</code> to 1.
Explicitly setting the value to 0 prevents <code>stratisd</code> from creating XFS
filesystems that are unmountable on earlier kernels.</p>
<p><code>stratisd</code> 3.6.2 includes a fix in the way thin devices are allocated in order
to avoid misalignment of distinct sections of the thin data device. Such
misalignments may result in a performance degradation.</p>
<p><code>stratisd</code> 3.6.1 includes a fix to correct a problem where <code>stratisd</code> would fail
to unlock a pool if the pool was encrypted using both Clevis and the kernel
keyring methods but the key in the kernel keyring was unavailable.</p>
<p>All releases include a number of housekeeping and maintenance updates.</p>

                                <p><em>mulhern, Stratis Team</em></p>
<p>Stratis 3.6.0 includes one significant enhancement as well as several smaller
improvements.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Stratis 3.6.0 extends its functionality to allow a user
to set a limit on the size of a filesystem. The limit can be set when the
filesystem is created, or at a later time.</p>
<p>In addition, Stratis 3.6.0 allows the user to stop a pool by specifying the pool
to stop either by UUID or by name, and allows better management of partially
constructed pools.</p>
<p>A new <code>--only</code> option was added to <code>stratis-dumpmetadata</code>, to allow it to print
only the pool-level metadata.</p>
<p><code>stratis-min</code>, the minimal CLI for Stratis, was extended with <code>bind</code>, <code>unbind</code>,
and <code>rebind</code> commands.</p>
<p>The <code>devicemapper</code> dependency lower bound is increased to 0.34.0 which
includes an enhancement to check for the presence of the udev daemon.
<code>stratisd</code> and <code>stratisd-min</code> now exit on startup if the udev daemon is not
present.</p>
<p>The <code>libcryptsetup-rs</code> dependency lower bound is increased to 0.9.1 and a
direct dependency is introduced on <code>libcryptsetup-rs-sys</code> 0.3.0 to allow
registering callbacks with libcryptsetup.</p>
<p>The <code>nix</code> dependency lower bound is increased to 0.26.3, to avoid compilation
errors induced by a fix to a lifetime bug in a function in <code>nix</code>'s public API.</p>
<p>The <code>serde_derive</code> dependency lower bound is increased to 1.0.185 to avoid
vendoring the <code>serde_derive</code> executable included in some prior versions of the
package.</p>
<p><code>stratisd</code> also contains sundry internal improvements, error message
enhancements, and so forth.</p>
<p>The <code>stratis-cli</code> command-line interface has been extended with an additional
option to set the filesystem size limit on creation and two new filesystem
commands, <code>set-size-limit</code> and <code>unset-size-limit</code>, to set or unset the
filesystem size limit after a filesystem has been created.</p>
<p><code>stratis-cli</code> now incorporates password verification when it is used to
set a key in the kernel keyring via manual entry.</p>
<p><code>stratis-cli</code> now allows specifying a pool by name or by UUID when stopping
a pool.</p>
<p><code>stratis-cli</code> also contains sundry internal improvements, and enforces
a python requirement of at least 3.9 in its package configuration.</p>

<p><code>stratisd</code> 3.5.8 principally contains changes to make handling of partially<br />
set up or torn down pools more robust. It also fixes a few errors and omissions
in the management of <code>stratisd</code>'s D-Bus layer, including supplying some
previously missing D-Bus property change signals and removing D-Bus object
paths to partially torn down pools which had in some cases persisted past the
point when the pool should be considered stopped. In addition, it removes
the <code>dracut</code> subpackage's dependency on plymouth.</p>

<p>Support for using Stratis as the root filesystem was added in version 2.4.0 but
without support in distribution installers it can be tricky for users to build
systems for testing.</p>
<p>This blog post will look at a quick method for installing systems with Stratis
as the root filesystem using the Fedora Live ISO, kickstart, and a Python script to
simplify and automate the process.</p>

<p>Based on recent questions, we wanted to develop a specific guide for additional steps that need to be taken
on Fedora to enable Stratis as the root filesystem for a Fedora install.</p>
<p>If you have not already looked at <a href="https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-rootfs/">the guide</a> for root filesystem work, please read that first. It is a
prerequisite.</p>
<p>For a little bit of background, stratisd provides an additional subpackage for our dracut modules that we
use to set up the root filesystem during early boot. This package installs the necessary modules for dracut
to automate the setup. However there are some steps that may not be obvious to users to get this all to work.
We'll cover them below.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>stratisd-dracut</code> package. This is the subpackage mentioned above.</li>
<li><em>Optional</em> If using Clevis for unlocking encrypted pools, add the following configuration
under /etc/dracut.conf.d/99-stratisd.conf:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>add_dracutmodules+=&quot; stratis-clevis &quot;
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Test your configuration or ensure you have a rescue kernel and initramfs in case the update of the
initramfs renders your install unbootable.</li>
<li>Once you've verified that everything works as expected, run <code>dracut --force --kver=[KERNEL_VERSION]</code></li>
</ol>

<p><code>stratisd</code> 3.5.2 includes three significant enhancements as well as a bug
fix.</p>
<p>The enhancements are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>stratisd</code> 3.5.2 is the first <code>stratisd</code> release to include a subpackage,
<code>stratisd-tools</code>, which incorporates <code>stratis-dumpmetadata</code>, an application
which may be used for troubleshooting.</li>
<li><code>stratisd</code> 3.5.2 now depends on <code>devicemapper-rs</code> 0.33.1, which includes
support for synchronization between udev and devicemapper. See
the <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/devicemapper-rs/blob/master/CHANGES.txt">devicemapper-rs</a> changelog and <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/pull/3069">stratisd pr 3069</a> for additional details.</li>
<li><code>stratisd</code> 3.5.2 modifies the way takeover by <code>stratisd</code> from <code>stratisd-min</code>
is managed during early boot. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/pull/3269">stratisd pr 3269</a> for further details.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>stratisd</code> 3.5.2 also fixes a bug in a script used by the stratisd-dracut
subpackage. This fix was included in the <code>stratisd</code> 3.5.1 release. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/pull/3256">stratisd pr 3256</a> for further details.</p>

<p>Stratis 3.5.0 includes one significant enhancement as well as several smaller
improvements.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Stratis 3.5.0 extends its functionality to allow a user
to add a cache to an encrypted pool. The cache devices are each encrypted with
the same mechanism as the data devices; consequently the cache itself is
encrypted.</p>
<p>Stratis 3.5.0 also fixes a few bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It extends the thin metadata device more eagerly, and responds to
thin metadata low water mark devicemapper events. This fix was included in
the <code>stratisd</code> 3.4.2 release.</li>
<li>It makes the pool name field in the Stratis LUKS2 metadata optional; this
prevents a failure to start an encrypted pool when upgrading from a previous
<code>stratisd</code> version to <code>stratisd</code> 3.4.0. This fix was included in the
<code>stratisd</code> 3.4.3 release.</li>
<li>It requires a new version of the Stratis devicemapper-rs library, which
contains a fix which eliminates undefined behavior in the management of ioctls
with large result values. This fix was included in the <code>stratisd</code> 3.4.4 release.</li>
<li>It requires a new version of the Stratis libblkid-rs library, which fixes a
memory leak in the <code>get_tag_value</code> method used by <code>stratisd</code>. This fix is not
included in any previous release.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also reduces the problem of repetitive log messages and modifies
the D-Bus API to eliminate the <code>redundancy</code> parameter previously required by 
the <code>CreatePool</code> D-Bus method.</p>

<p>Stratis 3.4.0 includes one significant enhancement as well as several smaller
improvements.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Stratis 3.4.0 extends its functionality to allow users to
specify a pool by its name when starting a stopped pool. Previously it was
only possible to identify a stopped pool by its UUID.</p>
<p>In addition, <code>stratisd</code> enforces some checks on the compatibility of the block
devices which make up a pool. It now takes into account the logical and
physical sector sizes of the individual block devices when creating a pool,
adding a cache, or extending the data or cache tier with additional devices.</p>
<p>The <code>stratis pool start</code> command has been modified to accept either a UUID
or a name option, while the <code>stratis pool list --stopped</code> command now displays
the pool name if it is available.</p>
<p>This release also includes improvements to <code>stratisd</code>'s internal locking
mechanism.</p>

<p>Stratis 3.3.0 includes one significant enhancement and several smaller
enhancements as well as number of stability and efficiency improvements.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Stratis 3.3.0 extends its functionality to allow users to
instruct <code>stratisd</code> to include additional space that may have become available
on a component data device in the space that is available to the device's pool.
The most typical use case for this is when a RAID device which presents as a
single device to <code>stratisd</code> is expanded.</p>
<p><code>stratis</code> supports these changes with a new command <code>stratis pool extend-data</code>
that allows the user to specify that the pool should make use of
additional space on its devices. The <code>stratis pool list</code> command has been
extended to show an alert if a pool's device has changed in size. The
<code>stratis blockdev list</code> command will display two device sizes if the size
that stratisd has on record differs from a device's detected size.</p>
<p>A less user-visible change is an improvement to the way that <code>stratisd</code>
allocates space for its thin pool metadata and data devices from the backing
store. The new approach is less precise but always more conservative when
allocating space for the thin pool metadata device and will consistently reduce
possible fragmentation of the thin pool metadata device over the backing
store.</p>
<p>Checks for Clevis executables occur whenever a Clevis executable that is
depended on by <code>stratisd</code> needs to be invoked to complete a user's command.
Previously, the check occurred only once, when <code>stratisd</code> was started. We
believe that this change will be more convenient for users who may install
needed Clevis executables after <code>stratisd</code> has already been started.</p>

<p>Stratis 3.2.0 includes one significant enhancement, one bug fix, and a number
of more minor improvements.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Stratis 3.2.0 extends its functionality to allow users to
stop and start a pool.</p>
<p>Stopping a pool consists of tearing down its storage stack in an orderly way,
but not destroying the pool metadata. It is a <code>pool destroy</code> operation
without the final step of wiping the Stratis metadata. Starting a pool is
setting up a pool according to the information stored in the pool level
metadata of the devices associated with a pool. Whether a pool is stopped or
started is stored in the pool-level metadata, with the consequence that users
can control whether a pool is automatically started when <code>stratisd</code> is started
up, or whether startup of the pool is deferred until explicitly requested.</p>
<p><code>stratis</code> supports these changes with new commands to start and to stop a
pool. It includes an additional <code>debug refresh</code> command which allows a user to
request that the state of all pools be refreshed. The <code>pool list</code> command has
been extended to allow a detailed view of individual pools and to allow the
user to examine stopped pools. The <code>pool unlock</code> command has been removed
in favor of the <code>pool start</code> command.</p>
<p>Other changes include a fix to the algorithm for determining the size of data 
and metadata devices that make up a thinpool device, the elimination of all
uses of <code>udevadm settle</code> in the <code>stratisd</code> engine, and general improvements to
the RPC layers used by <code>stratis-min</code> and <code>stratisd-min</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, the <code>stratisd-min</code> service now requires the <code>systemd-udevd</code>
service to ensure that Stratis filesystem symlinks are created when
<code>stratisd-min</code> sets up a Stratis filesystem.</p>

<p>Stratis 3.1.0 includes significant improvements to the management of the
thin-provisioning layers, as well as a number of other user-visible
enhancements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://stratis-storage.github.io/thin-provisioning-redesign/">this post</a> for a detailed discussion of the thin-provisioning
changes. To support these changes the Stratis CLI has been enhanced to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow specifying whether or not a pool may be overprovisioned on creation</li>
<li>allow changing whether or not a pool may be overprovisioned while it is
running</li>
<li>allow increasing the filesystem limit for a given pool</li>
<li>display whether or not a pool is overprovisioned in the pool list view</li>
</ul>
<p>Users of the Stratis CLI may also observe the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>debug</code> subcommand has been added to the <code>pool</code>, <code>filesystem</code>, and
<code>blockdev</code> subcommands. Debug commands are not fully supported and may change
or be removed at any time.</li>
<li>The <code>--redundancy</code> option is no longer available when creating a pool. This
option had only one permitted value so specifying it never had any effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>stratisd 3.1.0 includes one additional user-visible change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum size of a Stratis filesystem is increased to 512 MiB.</li>
</ul>
<p>stratisd 3.1.0 also includes a number of internal improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of any newly created MDV is increased to 512 MiB.</li>
<li>A pool's MDV is mounted in a private mount namespace and remains mounted
while the pool is in operation.</li>
<li>Improved handling of udev events on device removal.</li>
<li>The usual and customary improvements to log messages.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>For a while, we've bumped into a number of problems with our thin provisioning implementation
around reliability and safety for users. After gathering a lot of feedback on our thin
provisioning layer, we put together <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/2814">a proposal</a> for improvements to how we currently handle
allocations.</p>
<p>The changes can largely be divided up into three areas of improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predictability</li>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="predictability">Predictability</h1>
<p>We made two notable changes to make behavior in the thin provisioning layer well-defined and
predictable for users. Both parts relate to an existing thin provisioning tool,
<code>thin_metadata_size</code>. This tool allows users to calculate the amount of metadata needed for
a thin pool with a given size and number of thin devices (filesystems and snapshots in the
case of stratisd). We have started taking advantage of <code>thin_metadata_size</code> to make our
metadata space reservation more precise. Instead of our previous approach of allocating
a fixed fraction of the available space, we now calculate the exact amount of space required for
a given pool size and number of filesystems and snapshots. The second change is a switch
to lazy allocation. Previously, we allocated greedily which meant that every time a device
was added, we would allocate a certain amount of space for data and metadata regardless of
the individual user's requirements. We now delay allocation and allocate block device storage
on an as-needed basis allowing users to develop different requirements and adjust accordingly.
For example, a user may realize that they need more filesystems than they originally planned for.
With lazy allocation, assuming there is unallocated space on the pool, the user can now redirect
that unallocated space from data to metadata space so there is enough room for a greater
number of filesystems than was originally anticipated.</p>
<p>This change resulted in two API modifications. One is filesystem limits; to appropriately
ensure that we never exceed the allocated metadata limit, we set a filesystem limit per
pool. This limit can be increased through the API, triggering a new allocation for
metadata space. The other API change is related to the switch to lazy allocation. There
is now information available that reports the amount of space that has been allocated.
Previously we only concerned ourselves with used and total space, but with lazy allocation,
it is now also important to report space that has been allocated but may not be in use yet.</p>
<h1 id="safety">Safety</h1>
<p>A key drawback of thin provisioning is often the failure cases. When overprovisioning a
storage stack, the stack can get into a bad state when the pool becomes full due to the
filesystem being far larger than the pool backing it. We have added in two safety features
to help users cope with this.</p>
<p>One measure is the addition of a mode to disable overprovisioning. This ensures that the size
of all filesystems on the pool does not exceed the available physical storage provided by the
pool. This feature is not necessarily useful for all users, particularly with heavy snapshot
usage because even if storage is shared between a snapshot and a filesystem, this mode will
treat them as entirely independent entities in terms of storage cost. This ensures that copy-
on-write operations will not accidentally fill the pool if the shared storage diverges between
the two, but puts a rather strict limit on snapshot capacity. For users that use Stratis for
critical applications or the root filesystem, this mode prevents certain failure cases that
can be challenging to recover from.</p>
<p>When overprovisioning is enabled, we have also introduced a new API signal to notify the user
when physical storage has been fully allocated. This does not necessarily mean that the pool
has run out of space but serves as a warning to the user that once the remaining free space
fills up, Stratis has no space left to extend to. This gives users time to provide more storage
from which to allocate space before reaching a failure case.</p>
<h1 id="reliability">Reliability</h1>
<p>For a while, we've gotten bug reports about the reliability of filesystem extension. In certain
cases, Stratis was not able to handle filesystem extension smoothly or at all. Between the
<a href="https://stratis-storage.github.io/per-pool-locking/">per-pool locking</a> and the thin provisioning redesign, we have now resolved some of the
previous issues with filesystem extension. The approach we've taken attacks the problem from
a few different angles.</p>
<h2 id="earlier-filesystem-extension">Earlier filesystem extension</h2>
<p>Stratis used to wait until several gigabytes were left to extend the filesystem. If Stratis didn't
resize the filesystem quickly enough, the filesystem would run out of space before the extension
could complete. While this would eventually resolve itself once the filesystem was extended,
it would cause some unnecessary IO errors. We now extend the filesystem at 50% usage
to ensure that users always have a large buffer of free space available for even very IO-heavy
usage patterns.</p>
<h2 id="parallelized-filesystem-extension-operations">Parallelized filesystem extension operations</h2>
<p>Stratis could previously only iterate sequentially through pools. Now stratisd can handle filesystem
extension on two separate pools in parallel, reducing the latency between the point where
high usage is detected and the extension operation being performed.</p>
<h2 id="periodic-checks-for-filesystem-usage">Periodic checks for filesystem usage</h2>
<p>Checking filesystem usage used to be a devicemapper event-dependent operation. This led to
some problems around filesystem extension. A devicemapper event would be generated periodically
as the filesystem filled up, but if the filesystem failed to extend a few times,
devicemapper events would no longer be generated once the pool filled up and users would be
left with a filesystem that couldn't be extended. We've removed our dependency on devicemapper
events for filesystem monitoring and use devicemapper events for pool handling exclusively.
Instead, we run periodic checks in the background on filesystems to ensure that even if
filesystem extension fails multiple times, once the filesystem is ready to be extended,
stratisd can perform the operation in the background, so that we don't leave users in a state
where their filesystem can't be extended.</p>
<h1 id="migration-and-backwards-compatibility">Migration and backwards compatibility</h1>
<p>There are two types of changes that require migrations from older versions of stratisd: 
metadata changes and allocation scheme changes.</p>
<h2 id="metadata-changes">Metadata changes</h2>
<p>The changes we made required some schema changes in our MDA, the metadata region outside of
the superblock that records longer form JSON about the specifics of the pool topology. The
migration should be invisible to the user and will be performed the first time the new
version of stratisd detects legacy pools. The migration adds some additional devicemapper
information, information about filesystem limits on a pool, and other bookkeeping information.</p>
<h2 id="allocation-scheme-changes">Allocation scheme changes</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the previous metadata allocation scheme was less precise and allocated
a larger segment for metadata space than was necessary for the amount of data space present.
Migration for old pools will cause stratisd to detect that the metadata device is already larger
than it needs to be and no additional metadata device growth will occur until the data device
size becomes large enough to require additional metadata space.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future work</h1>
<p>We hope to eventually provide some smarter allocation strategies for our data and metadata
allocations to maximize contiguous allocation extents.</p>

<p>The D-Bus property changed signal sent on a change to the LockedPools

<p>The introspection data obtained via the &quot;org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable&quot;

method of the &quot;org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager&quot; D-Bus interface; it did
not include the specification of the out argument. This has been corrected.</p>

                                <p><em>John Baublitz, Stratis Team</em></p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Recently, we've merged a PR that completes our work on improved concurrency in
stratisd.  Previously, we had made some changes to the IPC layer to provide the
ability for stratisd to handle incoming requests in parallel which you can read
about <a href="https://stratis-storage.github.io/multi-threading/">here</a>. This work allowed IPC requests to each be handled
in a separate <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/spawning">tokio task</a>, but the Stratis engine, the part of our code that
handles all of the storage stack operations, could still only be accessed
sequentially.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>After having conversations with the LVM team, it seemed like sequential accesses
of storage operations was not entirely necessary. While modifying multiple layers
of the pool stack at once can cause problems, modifying independent pools in
parallel is safe, and we wanted to take advantage of the potential for increased
concurrency. A large part of this is due to how we handle D-Bus properties. Our
D-Bus properties expose aspects of the storage stack that sometimes require
querying the device-mapper stack for information. With sequential accesses,
this would mean that even two list operations on any two pools could not run in
parallel, a restriction that causes a bad user experience and is not technically
necessary.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>Despite the motivation being clear, the solution turned out to be more complicated.
One of the major problems that we bumped into when trying to achieve more granular
concurrency was the interaction between standard Rust synchronization structures
and the API for listing D-Bus objects.</p>
<p>Our initial idea was to wrap the data structure containing the record of all of
the pools in a read-write lock. This had a few notable drawbacks. For one, you
could not acquire mutable access to two independent pools at a time even though
this is a completely safe operation.</p>
<p>This led us to the idea of wrapping each pool in a read-write lock. Unfortunately,
this also had some major drawbacks. One notable example of this was the behavior of
our list operation with this solution. A list operation would require a read lock
on every single pool and this means that the time that it would take to list all of
the pools or filesystems would increase proportionally with the number of pools
on the system. Because locking is relatively expensive, we noticed a significant
slowdown when listing larger numbers of pools and filesystems.</p>
<p>Our ideal scenario was to have the benefits of a read-write lock so that list
operations could run in parallel but to provide an ability to either lock single
pools or all pools in one operation so that locking all pools would take the
same amount of time no matter how many were present on the system.</p>
<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<p>After determining that no locking data structure like this appeared to exist
in tokio, we took some time to look into how tokio implements its locking data
structures. The API for much of the locking data structures appeared to
be a lock acquisition method that returned a future. This future would poll the state
of the lock and either update the internal data structures to indicate that
the lock had been acquired or put itself to sleep until it was ready to poll
again. The <code>drop</code> method on the data structure returned by the future would
trigger waking up a task to poll again. This seemed perfectly workable with
a more granular read-write lock. The only difference would be that we would
need to keep track of locks on individual pools as well as locks on the entire
collection. The proper locking conflict rules would need to be checked:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WriteAll</code> conflicts with all other operations.</li>
<li><code>ReadAll</code> conflicts with <code>WriteAll</code> and <code>Write</code> on any pool.</li>
<li><code>Write</code> conflicts with <code>WriteAll</code> and <code>Read</code> or <code>Write</code> on the same pool.</li>
<li><code>Read</code> conflicts with <code>WriteAll</code> and <code>Write</code> on the same pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any attempt to acquire two conflicting locks would queue one of the tasks to
be woken up once the conflicting lock was dropped.</p>
<h1 id="notable-design-choices">Notable design choices</h1>
<p>We chose to implement our lock as a starvation-free lock. Implementing a lock
that allows <code>ReadAll</code> to bypass <code>Write*</code> requests that are queued when another
<code>ReadAll</code> request has already acquired the lock leads to behavior where <code>Write*</code>
requests could block indefinitely. This behavior could cause list operations to
block filesystem extension handling indefinitely, potentially leading to IO errors
and a full filesystem. A starvation-free locking approach puts a task in a FIFO
queue if any are already queued in front of it. The notable downside of this is
slightly more latency for handling locking requests, but the benefits seemed to
outweigh this.</p>
<p>Because tokio can cause spurious wake ups for tasks, we assign a unique integer
ID to each future responsible for polling the lock for readiness. In the case
where there is both a legitimate and spurious wake up at the same time, this
allows our lock to differentiate between the two woken tasks to determine which
one should be given priority and which should be put to sleep. This prevents
spurious wake ups from acquiring the lock before they are scheduled to.</p>
<p>Because tokio does not currently allow lifetimes shorter than <code>'static</code> when
passing a reference across thread boundaries, our locking data structure
heavily uses automatic reference counting (<code>Arc</code>). This enables shared access
between multiple threads and the ability to pass an acquired lock handle to
a separate thread after acquisition. Without the use of <code>Arc</code>, the pool would
have to be operated on in the same task as the lock acquisition which would
prevent passing lock handles to separate tasks to process them in parallel.</p>
<h1 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h1>
<p>After our initial implementation of the write-all lock, we bumped into an issue
where we could not pass all pool lock handles into separate threads to handle
them all in parallel. This was particularly problematic for our implementation
of background devicemapper event handling. Our solution for this was to allow
acquiring all locks at once to avoid the penalty of locking each pool individually
and then converting that lock handle to a set of individual locks that can all
be released when they are no longer needed. This addressed both the issue of
parallelization and constant time locking for all pools nicely.</p>
<p>Originally we also only woke one queued task at a time when a lock was released.
This proved to be less performant. If two <code>ReadAll</code> tasks were queued, these could
both be woken up in parallel and acquire the lock with no conflict. The solution
to this was to factor out the part of the code that tests for conflicts and traverse
the queue and wake up all tasks until a conflicting task is found. This allowed
waking up a batch of queued tasks that could all operate in parallel without
also waking up a conflicting task that would immediately be put back to sleep.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future work</h1>
<p>Recently, we discovered that we should be able to provide even more
parallelization for filesystem background operations. While we cannot perform
multiple pool mutation operations in parallel, the filesystems on top of the
pool can be modified independently in parallel. We expect to change the way
background checks on filesystem usage are handled by spawning each filesystem
extension in its own tokio task so that, for pools with many filesystems, the
filesystem extension will be more responsive. Rather than iterating through
hundreds of filesystems, stratisd will be able to handle multiple filesystem
extensions in parallel, speeding up the checking process if there is more than
one filesystem that needs to be extended at once. This will benefit IO performance
by ensuring that the filesystems are extended in a timely manner to avoid cases
where the filesystem is filled before it can be extended.</p>
<h1 id="final-notes">Final notes</h1>
<p>We've added extensive debugging for the locking data structure in case users run
into issues. To enable these logs and see the state of the per-pool locking data
structure over time, simply enable trace logs in stratisd!</p>

                                <p><em>mulhern, Stratis Team</em></p>
<p>Stratis 3.0.0 includes many internal improvements, bug fixes, and
user-visible changes.</p>
<p>Users of the Stratis CLI may observe the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to set the filesystem logical size when creating a
filesystem.</li>
<li>It is possible to rebind a pool using a Clevis tang server or with a key
in the kernel keyring.</li>
<li>Filesystem and pool list output have been extended and improved. The pool
listing includes an <code>Alerts</code> column. Currently this column is used to indicate
whether the pool is in a restricted operation mode. A new subcommand,
<code>stratis pool explain</code>, which provides a fuller explanation of the codes
displayed in the <code>Alerts</code> column has been added.  The filesystem listing
now displays a filesystem's logical size.</li>
<li>With encrypted pools it was previously possible for the display of block
device paths to change format if <code>stratisd</code> was restarted after an encrypted
pool had been created. Now the display of the block device paths is consistent
across <code>stratisd</code> restarts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In stratisd 3.0.0 the D-Bus API has undergone a revision and the prior
interfaces are all removed. The <code>FetchProperties</code> interfaces that
were supported by all objects have been removed. The values that were
previously obtainable via the <code>FetchProperties</code> methods
are now conventional D-Bus properties. The possible values of error codes
returned by the D-Bus methods have been reduced to 0 and 1, with the usual
interpretation.</p>
<p>stratisd 3.0.0 includes a number of significant internal improvements and a few
bug fixes.</p>
<p><code>stratisd</code> bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously the Stratis release included a dracut.conf.d file which made
the Stratis dracut modules required in the initramfs. The consequence of this
was that the initramfs could not be built unless all files required for the
Stratis modules were present; if the initramfs is not built a reboot will fail.
That file has been removed in this release.</li>
<li>The <code>--prompt</code> option was not passed to <code>stratis-min</code> in the
<code>stratis-fstab-setup</code> script; this prevented the user from entering the
password necessary to unlock an encrypted pool during boot. This is
no longer the case.</li>
<li>Previously, stratisd did not increase the amount of space allocated to
its spare metadata device when its in-use thinpool metadata device was
extended. In some situations, when setting up a pool, stratisd might attempt
a repair operation on the thinpool metadata device; if the space allocated
for the spare metadata device was not large enough to accommodate all the
metadata, then the repair operation would fail. Now the space allocated for
the spare metadata device is increased whenever the metadata device is extended.</li>
<li><code>stratisd</code> was not immediately updating the devicemapper device stack when
a cache was initialized with the result that the cache was not immediately
put in use. This is no longer the case.</li>
<li><code>stratisd</code> was not immediately updating the Clevis encryption info associated
with a pool on a command to bind an encrypted pool with Clevis. This problem
has been corrected.</li>
<li><code>stratisd</code> was sending an incorrect D-Bus signal on a pool name change; this
has been fixed.</li>
<li>Previously, when <code>stratisd-min</code>, which runs during boot before D-Bus
functionality is available, gave way to <code>stratisd</code> when the D-Bus had been set
up, it was possible for inconsistencies to arise if the Stratis engine was
performing an operation which required invoking a distinct executable. The
executable might be terminated during its execution, and <code>stratisd-min</code> would
take the action appropriate to the command failure before exiting. Now, systemd
is instructed to send a kill signal only to <code>stratisd-min</code> and not to any of
<code>stratisd-min</code>'s child processes when shutting down <code>stratisd-min</code>.</li>
<li>Previously, if the same device was specified using two different paths
when creating or extending a pool the different paths would be
interpreted as two different devices and an error would be returned when
<code>stratisd</code> attempted to initialize the device a second time. Now, the
different paths are canonicalized eagerly, and converted into a single
canonical representation of the device, <code>stratisd</code> initializes the device only
once, and no error is returned.</li>
<li>Previously, <code>stratisd</code> did not report all existing object paths in the
result of a D-Bus Introspect() call. This was due to a bug in version
0.9.1 and previous of <code>stratisd</code>'s dbus-tree dependency. <code>stratisd</code> now
requires dbus-tree 0.9.2, so all nodes are reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other <code>stratisd</code> improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, <code>stratisd</code> relied entirely on udev information when deciding
whether a storage device was not in use by another application and could
safely be overwritten with Stratis metadata. Now it performs a supplementary
check using libblkid and exits with an error if libblkid reports that the
device is in use.</li>
<li>Handling of errors returned by internal methods is improved; a chaining
mechanism has been introduced and the error chains can be scrutinized
programatically to identify expected scenarios like rollback failures.</li>
<li>A set of states indicating that a pool has reduced capability have been
added internally and are published on the D-Bus. A pool's capability is
reduced on an error being returned internally which contains, somewhere in
its chain, the appropriate identifying error variant.</li>
<li>The code used to roll back failed encryption operations on a list of
pool devices has been refactored and generalized. It is now capable of
returning an error that can be used to identify a restricted pool capability
due to a rollback failure.</li>
<li><code>stratisd</code> uses sha-256 instead of sha-1 for Clevis-related encryption
operations to conform with Clevis's own usage.</li>
<li><code>stratisd</code> exits more elegantly and less frequently if it encounters an
error during execution of the distinct tasks that are assigned to the
individual threads that it manages internally.</li>
<li>In preparation for edition 2021 of the Rust language, <code>stratisd</code> source code
has been updated to conform entirely to edition 2018 recommendations.</li>

<p>The next version of stratisd will be 3.0.0.</p>
<p>We have already decided on two breaking changes for this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will collapse all the non-zero error codes returned over the D-Bus
on an engine error into a single error code, 1.</li>
<li>We will remove all the backwards compatible D-Bus interfaces corresponding
to stratisd 2 and will supply just a single D-Bus interface for stratisd 3.
Subsequent minor releases of stratisd 3 will retain their backwards compatible
interfaces as described in the <a href="https://stratis-storage.github.io/DBusAPIReference.pdf">DBus API Reference</a>. Each interface will have 
a simplified naming convention, always specifying the major version and
using the stratisd minor version in the revision number. For example, the name
of the filesystem D-Bus interface under the new system for stratisd 3.0.0 is 
<code>org.storage.stratis3.filesystem.r0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The motivation for both these changes is the most typical of all: the
implementation of stratisd will become unwieldly and bug-ridden if we try to
maintain backwards compatibility in the D-Bus layer while simultaneously
doing necessary redesign, re-implementation, and enhancement of the stratisd
engine. In particular, changes to the way errors are managed internally will
not allow us to ensure consistency of error codes returned over the D-Bus with
the ones that were previously used.</p>
<p>Since we are increasing the major version, dropping the stratisd 2 D-Bus API is
an obvious next step.</p>
<p>We are reviewing other possible API changes at this time in order to minimize
the number of subsequent major version increases that we will be obliged to do.</p>

                                <p><em>mulhern, Stratis Team</em></p>
<p>For Fedora packaging, we have decided to split out the dracut support into
a separate subpackage, <code>stratisd-dracut</code>. This package must be installed
in order to support booting from a Stratis filesystem. All other
functionality is included in the <code>stratisd</code> package.</p>
<p>The motivation for this change is to allow users greater flexibility and
robustness. We understand that some users may choose to use Stratis but not to
use Stratis for their root filesystem. These users may choose to install only
the <code>stratisd</code> package.</p>
<p>Other users may prefer to use a Stratis root filesystem. They should install
the <code>stratisd-dracut</code> package, which has a hard dependency on the <code>stratisd</code>
package. The <code>stratisd-dracut</code> package also includes a hard dependency on
<code>dracut</code> itself and on <code>plymouth</code>. <code>plymouth</code> is used in order to obtain a
password to unlock an encrypted Stratis root filesystem. Please consult
[Stratis filesystem as the root filesystem] for further information about
Stratis support for a root filesystem.</p>
<p>We decided to implement this division due to a problem which would ensue
if stratisd was installed but plymouth was not. In that case, the regeneration
of the initramfs on kernel updates would fail and render the system unbootable
with the new kernel.</p>
<p>The solution of adding plymouth as a hard requirement for stratisd would
place an unnecessary dependency burden on a user who did not choose to
maintain a Stratis root filesystem. However, without such a requirement a
user who had stratisd but not plymouth installed would eventually end up
with an unbootable system.</p>
<p>We believe that a separate subpackage is the most robust and flexible
solution; it is one which requires no manual intervention by the user.</p>
<p>To properly construct the stratisd-dracut subpackage, it is imperative that
the stratisd source code be compiled twice; once with the default features,
in order to build stratisd itself, and again with a different set of
features, in order to correctly build supporting scripts for the dracut
module.</p>
<p>We recommend that other downstream packagers adopt a similar scheme.</p>

<p>Stratis 2.4.1 is a bug fix release, which addresses a flaw in the
multi-threading implementation.</p>
<p>A user could observe the behavior caused by the flaw when CLI commands would
either take far longer to complete than normal or the D-Bus connection would
eventually time out.</p>
<p>The cause of the observed problem was that stratisd was accepting a
GetManagedObjects call on the D-Bus but not returning the result. This
could occur when numerous object paths, i.e., several hundred, were being
supported on the D-Bus, generally due to the creation of many filesystems.</p>
<p>We have addressed this problem by:</p>
<ul>
<li>modifying the D-Bus message handling implementation</li>
<li>implementing a custom ObjectManager class in the D-Bus layer</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we have refined the method by which individual threads are
terminated when stratisd receives a shutdown signal to better terminate the
D-Bus message handling thread.</p>
<p>The stratisd 2.4.1 release includes one additional fix: the signals
associated with r4 D-Bus interfaces were not being sent appropriately,
now they are.</p>
<p>In addition, stratisd 2.4.1 includes logging, at the trace level, of lock
aquisitions and releases and additional logging in the systemd generators
included with the release.</p>
<p>The stratis-cli 2.4.1 release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an improvement to the listing of block devices</li>
<li>a new report with key <code>managed_objects_report</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Stratis 2.4.0 includes two major user-visible changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the functionality required to boot from a Stratis-managed root
filesystem. See the prior post <a href="https://stratis-storage.github.io/stratis-rootfs/">Stratis filesystems as the root filesystem</a>
for a more detailed discussion.</li>
<li>An enhancement to existing encryption support that allows the user to
create a pool with encryption managed either by the kernel keyring or
<a href="https://github.com/latchset/clevis">Clevis</a>, and to subsequently bind an already encrypted pool using either
mechanism. Previously, the user could create an encrypted pool using the
kernel keyring only, and could bind or unbind using Clevis only.</li>
</ul>
<p>More minor user-visible changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An enhancment to the FetchProperties D-Bus interface in order to disclose
more information about sets of encrypted devices.</li>
<li>The <code>engine_state_report</code> key in the report interface has been stabilized
and is guaranteed to be supported in future releases.</li>
<li>A new executable, <code>stratis-predict-usage</code> to predict free space on a newly
created pool is distributed with stratisd.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release of Stratis also includes a number of significant but less
visible changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multi-threading in stratisd. The new multi-threading
implementation replaces the prior event-loop implementation. See the prior
post <a href="https://stratis-storage.github.io/multi-threading/">Multi-threading Support in stratisd</a> for a detailed discussion.</li>
<li>The management of Stratis filesystem symlinks has been simplified.
Determining the filesystem and pool name that comprise the symlink path no
longer requires communication with stratisd over the D-Bus; it is
now accomplished via standard udev-based mechanisms.</li>
<li>stratisd now emits a log message at the info level in connection with every
mutating D-Bus method call that it completes without an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>The support for migrating symlinks introduced in Stratis 2.2.0 is no longer
included in this release.</p>
<p>The ongoing and perpetual but entirely routine work of improvements to
individual log and error messages continues.</p>

                                <p><em>John Baublitz, Stratis Team</em></p>
<p>While Stratis unencrypted pools could previously be used as the root filesystem
for a Linux installation with proper customization of the initramfs, our most
recent feature provides all of the plumbing to fully support Stratis filesystems
as the root filesystem of a Linux installation.</p>
<h3 id="ipc">IPC</h3>
<p>Stratis relies on D-Bus for interprocess communication between the daemon and the
client. D-Bus does not currently ship in the initramfs so the first order of business
was to choose an alternate form of IPC. Because we require the ability to pass a file
descriptor from the client to the daemon, this made Unix sockets the only reasonable
transport mechanism. After evaluating several JSON RPC libraries with Unix socket
support, we decided to write a minimal RPC interface ourselves. This was due to a
few constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON RPC libraries with Unix socket support did not support setting the ancillary
data for packets required to send file descriptors.</li>
<li>The libraries had relatively complicated threading models, and we preferred to take
a simple approach of processing each new request using a Tokio task.</li>
<li>It was relatively trivial to serialize full data structures as JSON thanks to
[<code>serde_json</code>].</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach proved successful and we were able to implement an IPC mechanism
that left our internal stratisd API unchanged. The alternate IPC mechanism is
distributed in a separate pair of executables, stratis-min and stratisd-min.</p>
<h3 id="support-in-the-initramfs">Support in the initramfs</h3>
<p>The next step was to integrate stratisd-min into the initramfs. This involved quite a
bit of configuration for dracut and systemd.</p>
<p>Our current model uses systemd generators that are enabled by passing information on
the kernel command line at boot to properly set up and unlock any devices that need
to be unlocked. We aim to do this in as user-friendly of a way as possible by
leveraging existing tools like Plymouth to handle prompting users for a passphrase
on the splash screen.</p>
<p>To set up the generators and necessary dependencies, we wrote two dracut modules:
stratis and stratis-clevis. stratis-clevis depends on stratis and is required for
automated unlocking using clevis.</p>
<p>The required information on the kernel command line is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code> root=[STRATIS_FS_SYMLINK]</code>: The symlink under <code>/dev/stratis</code> that corresponds to
the desired Stratis filesystem. This is required by dracut.</li>
<li><code> stratis.rootfs.pool_uuid=[POOL_UUID]</code>: The UUID of the pool that contains the
root filesystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user requires networking (for example, unlocking a pool using Tang), the
parameter <code>rd.neednet=1</code> is required as well.</p>
<h3 id="testing-on-fedora-using-anaconda">Testing on Fedora using Anaconda</h3>
<p>This process was relatively simple once it came time to test with Fedora. Anaconda
provides the parameter <code>--dirinstall</code> which allows the user to install into a path
with the mounted Stratis filesystem as the root directory. It requires a bit more
configuration after the fact (manual <code>/etc/fstab</code> or <code>.mount</code> file configuration) but
works quite well.</p>
<h3 id="etc-fstab-or-mount-files"><code>/etc/fstab</code> or <code>.mount</code> files</h3>
<p>We now also provide a systemd service to manage setting up non-root filesystems in
/etc/fstab.  For devices that require a passphrase or are critical for a working
system, the following line can be used:</p>
<p><code>/dev/stratis/[STRATIS_SYMLINK] [MOUNT_POINT] xfs defaults,x-systemd.requires=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service,x-systemd.after=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service 0 2</code></p>
<p>The absence of <code>nofail</code> here is due to the fact that <code>nofail</code> causes the boot to
proceed prior to a successful mount. This means that passphrase prompts
will not work properly, and most users will want critical system partitions to be
mounted successfully or else have the boot fail.</p>
<p>For devices that do not require interaction to set up, such as unencrypted devices or
devices that have Clevis bindings, and are not critical for a working system, the
following line can be optionally used:</p>
<p><code>/dev/stratis/[STRATIS_SYMLINK] [MOUNT_POINT] xfs defaults,x-systemd.requires=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service,x-systemd.after=stratis-fstab-setup@[POOL_UUID].service,nofail 0 2</code></p>
<p>The addition of <code>nofail</code> here will cause mounting of this device to proceed
independently from the boot which can speed up boot times. The set up process will
continue running in the background until it either succeeds or fails.</p>
<p>Because the root filesystem is mostly set up in the initramfs, the entry is slightly
different and does not require the <code>stratis-fstab-setup</code> service. It should be:</p>
<p><code>/dev/stratis/[STRATIS_SYMLINK] / xfs defaults 0 1</code></p>
<h3 id="recovery-console">Recovery console</h3>
<p>While we mention above that stratisd could previously be used in the initramfs, there
is one major caveat: it could be started but commands could not be issued. This had
one major drawback of not allowing users to interact with stratisd in the recovery
console. D-Bus is not available in the recovery console, so the move to stratis-min
and stratisd-min now allows users to perform recovery actions in the emergency console
by starting stratisd-min and running the necessary commands using stratis-min. This
will make rescuing systems that do not boot significantly easier moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="scope-of-dracut-modules-and-systemd-service-files">Scope of dracut modules and systemd service files</h3>
<p>While our dracut modules and systemd service files are meant to work for almost all
users, they may not meet the requirements of everyone using them. We encourage those
with more advanced configurations to design their own configurations and reach out
for guidance as needed. Our configuration is also meant as a template that you can
build on!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>While this took quite a bit of effort to put all of the pieces together, the Linux
boot utilities had all of the features we needed to accomplish this. We're excited
for future work with other teams to make using Stratis as the root filesystem
for Linux installations even easier!</p>
<h3 id="release-version">Release version</h3>
<p>All of the utilities required for booting from a Stratis filesystem as the root
filesystem will be included in stratisd 2.4.0.</p>

<p><code>stratisd</code> is an entirely single-threaded application;
it is a daemon with a single event loop that consults a list of possible
event sources in a prescribed order, handling the events on each event
source before proceeding to the next.
The event sources are udev, device-mapper, and D-Bus events which are
handled in that order. <code>stratisd</code> can also be terminated cleanly by an
interrupt signal, which it checks for on every loop iteration.</p>
<p>Because <code>stratisd</code> is single threaded, every action taken by <code>stratisd</code> must be
completed before another action is performed. For example, if a client issues
a D-Bus message to create a filesystem, that command will be processed, the
engine will create a filesystem, and a response will be transmitted on the
D-Bus before any other action can be taken. If another D-Bus message is
received before the first is completed, that D-Bus message will then be
processed.  The engine will continue to process D-Bus messages until none are
left, preventing it from handling any other categories of signals or
events while any D-Bus messages remain.</p>
<p>For this reason, <code>stratisd</code> itself can not parallelize long-running
operations. It is well known that, for example, filesystem creation can be
time consuming, as it is necessary to write the filesystem metadata when
creating the filesystem. Ideally, <code>stratisd</code> would be able to run such time
consuming operations in parallel, initiating one operation and then
proceeding to initiate another before the first operation completes.</p>
<p>Additionally, as in the example above, if <code>stratisd</code> is continually receiving
D-Bus messages, it will not proceed to deal with a device-mapper event,
even if the device-mapper event is urgent and not in any conflict with the
D-Bus messages, for example, if it is associated with a different pool than
any D-Bus messages.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the next release introduces multi-threading capabilities
into <code>stratisd</code>. These capabilities do not solve all the problems that
multi-threading is intended to solve, but lay the essential foundation for
multi-threaded event handling.</p>
<p>We have chosen to implement multi-threading using the Rust <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a> crate.
The alternative is to use operating system threads explicitly via the
Rust standard library <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/">thread</a> module. We have chosen <code>tokio</code> in order to
get the benefits of code reuse from the <code>tokio</code> runtime, and because we
expect that this choice will allow <code>stratisd</code> to operate efficiently while
consuming fewer operating system resources.</p>
<p>We have also made use of the newest version of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dbus">dbus</a> crate, which
includes support for multi-threading via the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dbus-tokio/">dbus-tokio</a> crate.</p>
<h1 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h1>
<p>The following words have a precise definition in the context of
multi-threading:</p>
<ul>
<li>object - an instance of a Rust struct and the methods implemented for it.</li>
<li>task - A task is a program which has been designed so that it can
be run concurrently  with its fellow tasks. The multi-threaded incarnation
of <code>stratisd</code> consists of a set of tasks, some code to facilitate interactions
between the tasks, and the <code>tokio</code> runtime.</li>
<li>context - the context of a process is all the information required to
begin running the process when it resumes after having been suspended by the
operating system scheduler. A context switch is the action of storing this
information for the process being suspended and loading the information for
the process being resumed.</li>
<li>thread - a thread is a sub-division of a process. When an operating system
switches processes, a context switch is required. When an operating
system switches threads, the new thread shares much of its process' context
with the previous thread. Consequently, switching between threads, as opposed
to processes, may be an order of magnitude less expensive. All threads
belonging to a process share the same memory and may communicate via this
shared memory.</li>
<li>runtime - the <code>tokio</code> runtime manages scheduling of tasks.</li>
<li>block - a task is said to block on an operation if the task must wait
for the operation to complete and is not able to be replaced in the same
thread by another task until the operation is completed. Examples of typical
operations are I/O or network interactions. Another sort of operation is
the acquisition of a shared resource via a mutex or other synchronization
primitive.</li>
<li>blocking - a blocking task is a task that may block.</li>
<li>non-blocking - a non-blocking task is a task that does not need to wait
for any operation to complete; if it initiates an operation that may take
a while to complete, it is able to yield to another task, and may be resumed
later from the instruction where it yielded.</li>
<li>mutex - a synchronization primitive which enforces mutual exclusion. With
<code>tokio</code> the exclusion is enforced on a particular object. If a task obtains
a mutex, it has exclusive use of the object until it releases the mutex.  If
a mutex is already held by another task, a task requesting the mutex may
block or it may yield until the mutex can be obtained.</li>
<li>read/write lock - a mutex which is relaxed in so far as that it allows
multiple tasks to share an object if none mutate the object. If a task
mutates the object then it must obtain exclusive possession of the mutex.</li>
<li>lock - to enter a mutex guarding an object is synonymous with locking
an object.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<p><code>stratisd</code> divides its work among a number of tasks which handle
different event sources. Some tasks are non-blocking, others are blocking
tasks. Non-blocking tasks may yield, and can share a single thread with
other non-blocking tasks. The tasks communicate using two unbounded MPSC
(Multi-Producer Single-Consumer) channels; a channel for udev events and
a channel for D-Bus updates.</p>
<h2 id="termination-variable">Termination Variable</h2>
<p>One boolean variable, <code>should_exit</code>, is shared among some of the tasks.
It is set to true only if SIGINT is detected. It is observed only by the
udev task, which checks its value on every iteration of its loop, and
immediately returns if the value is <code>true</code>. For all other tasks, termination
is handled by <code>tokio</code> constructs. The udev task requires special handling
because it does not yield and because it contains a non-terminating loop.</p>
<h2 id="the-dbus-tree">The dbus <code>tree</code></h2>
<p>The dbus tree is a data structure which contains the state of the D-Bus
layers. Access to the dbus tree is controlled by a read/write lock.</p>
<h2 id="the-stratisd-engine">The stratisd engine</h2>
<p>The <code>stratisd</code> engine is the core of the <code>stratisd</code> daemon. It manages all the
essential functionality of <code>stratisd</code>. Access to the engine is controlled
by a mutex.</p>
<h2 id="the-dbus-channel">The dbus channel</h2>
<p>The dbus channel is an unbounded multi-producer, single-consumer channel.
It carries messages instructing the DbusTreeHandler how to update the dbus
tree. The DbusTreeHandler task is the unique consumer of the messages.
The DbusConnectionHandler, which processes D-Bus messages sent by the client,
and the DbusUdevhandler, which handles udev events, may both place messages
on the dbus channel.</p>
<h2 id="the-udev-channel">The udev channel</h2>
<p>The udev channel is an unbounded multi-producer, single-consumer channel.
It carries messages about udev events to the DbusUdevHandler. There is
only one producer for this channel, the udev event handling task,
which monitors udev events and places those events on the channel.</p>
<h2 id="signal-handling-task">signal handling task</h2>
<p>The signal handling task is a non-blocking task which waits for SIGINT. If
it receives the signal it sets <code>should_exit</code> to true and finishes.</p>
<h2 id="device-mapper-event-task">device-mapper event task</h2>
<p>The device-mapper event task loops forever waiting for a device-mapper event.
On receipt of any event, it locks the <code>stratisd</code> engine, and processes the
event. It yields when waiting for a new device-mapper event or when waiting
for a lock on the engine.</p>
<h2 id="udev-event-handling-task">udev event handling task</h2>
<p>The udev event handling task uses a polling mechanism to detect udev events.
If a udev event is detected it places a message on the <code>stratisd</code> udev channel.
It reads <code>should_exit</code> after every udev event or, if no udev event has
occurred, after a designated time interval. If  <code>should_exit</code> is <code>true</code> when
read it returns immediately.</p>
<h2 id="d-bus-tasks">D-Bus Tasks</h2>
<p>The management of the D-Bus layer is handled by several cooperating tasks.
The dbus crate supplies one task, which detects D-Bus messages and places
them on its own unbounded channel. The <code>stratisd</code> tasks are the
DbusTreeHandler task, the DbusConnectionHandler task, and the
DbusUdevHandler task.</p>
<h2 id="dbustreehandler-task">DbusTreeHandler task</h2>
<p><code>stratisd</code> defines a DbusTreehandler task which updates the dbus tree and
may also handle emitting D-Bus signals. It is the unique receiver on
the <code>stratisd</code> dbus channel and the only task which obtains a write lock
on the dbus tree. It is a non-blocking task.</p>
<h2 id="dbusconnectionhandler-task">DbusConnectionHandler task</h2>
<p><code>stratisd</code> defines a DbusConnectionHandler task which spawns a
new task for every D-Bus method call. Each spawned task obtains a read
lock on the dbus tree before it begins to process the D-Bus method call,
and may also lock the engine. If it locks the engine, it blocks on the lock.
Each spawned task may place messages on the <code>stratisd</code> dbus channel. Each
task is responsible for sending replies to its D-Bus message on the D-Bus.
This is the only part of the implementation where new tasks can be spawned
during <code>stratisd</code>'s regular operation.</p>
<h2 id="dbusudevhandler-task">DbusUdevHandler task</h2>
<p><code>stratisd</code> defines a DbusUdevHandler task which removes udev event information
from the <code>stratisd</code> udev channel, allows the engine to process it, and puts
any messages that may be necessary as a result of the engine processing the
udev event on the <code>stratisd</code> dbus channel. Currently, a udev event may result in
a pool being set up; when that happens an add message must be placed on the
dbus channel for every filesystem or block device belonging to the pool,
as well as an add message for the pool itself. The DbusUdevHandler locks
the engine when processing a udev event, but does not block on the lock.</p>
<h1 id="properties-and-consequences">Properties and Consequences</h1>
<h2 id="unbounded-channels">Unbounded Channels</h2>
<p>Both the <code>stratisd</code> udev channel and the dbus channel are &quot;unbounded channels&quot;.
These &quot;unbounded&quot; channels are actually bounded, but the bound on the number
of messages allowed on the channel is the maximum value of the Rust usize type.
It is assumed that other machine limits will be encountered before the number
of messages on the channel reaches that limit. Because both channels are
unbounded, tasks do not block placing a message on the channel, sending
always succeeds.</p>
<p>We chose to make the dbus channel unbounded, as there exist two situations
where a large number of messages may be placed on the channel. When a pool
is constructed, the number of messages placed on the channel is proportional
to the number of devices in the pool. On startup, when <code>stratisd</code> sets up
a pool from its constituent devices, the number of messages is proportional
to the number of devices and to the number of filesystems that the pool
supports. We prefer to use an unbounded channel rather than to bound the
number of filesystems by the channel size.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we expect the number of messages on the channel, except
on the occasion of pool creation or setup, to be no greater than 1; no other
action currently implemented requires more than one message to be sent to the
DbusTreeHandler. Messages will be rapidly consumed by the DbusTreeHandler, as
it is the only task that takes a write lock on the dbus tree, and a task
waiting for a write lock takes precedence over one waiting for a read lock.</p>
<p>The choice of unbounded channels also eliminates one possible source of
deadlock.</p>
<h2 id="bounded-number-of-blocking-threads">Bounded Number of Blocking Threads</h2>
<p>We have accepted, at this time, the <code>tokio</code> default for the number of blocking
threads, which is 512. Because the DbusConnectionHandler's generated tasks
are blocking, this places an upper bound on the number of
distinct D-Bus messages that can be handled concurrently. Note that it
is quite possible for 512 D-Bus messages to be handled by just one thread,
as each task may be run in sequence on a single thread if the tasks complete
rapidly.</p>
<p>We do not believe that this restriction will prove important in practice.
The dbus crate's message channel is unbounded, so D-Bus messages can not be
dropped although they may be handled very slowly if there is a backlog.
Depending on the client's configuration, this may cause the client to hang
indefinitely waiting for a response or the client may receive a message
indicating that no response was transmitted in the allotted time. However,
this situation can only arise if many messages require long-running actions
to be taken and if these messages are sent in parallel.</p>
<p>In any case, the improvement with respect to a single-threaded approach is
obvious. In the existing single threaded design, <code>stratisd</code> would be
unable to handle any other events until all the D-Bus messages had been
handled. With the multi-threaded design, udev and device-mapper events can
be handled when they arrive, interspersed with the handling of the D-Bus
messages.</p>
<h2 id="one-task-per-d-bus-message-model">One Task per D-Bus Message Model</h2>
<p>In the single-threaded design, every D-Bus message is handled completely
before handling of the next D-Bus message is begun. In our multi-threaded
design multiple D-Bus message handling tasks may be being processed at the same
time if the <code>tokio</code> scheduler allocates two message handling tasks to separate
threads.</p>
<p>Each such task must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acquire a read lock on the dbus tree.</li>
<li>Query the tree in order to find the necessary information to call the engine
method.</li>
<li>Enter a mutex on the <code>stratisd</code> engine.</li>
<li>Operate on the <code>stratisd</code> engine.</li>
<li>Place any required messages on the dbus channel.</li>
<li>Exit the mutex.</li>
<li>Relinquish the read lock.</li>
</ol>
<p>While processing of each message will be started precisely in the sequence
in which the messages arrive, the order in which messages complete may not
be the same, because a later task may enter the engine mutex before an earlier
task.</p>
<p>The motivation for this design is obvious, although the benefits are not
yet realized in this preliminary multi-threading implementation. In future,
we expect to relax the requirement that each task have exclusive access to
the entire engine and lock only the relevant parts of the engine. With that
extension two non-interfering D-Bus commands may be run separately. The
same general advantage from this proposed enhancement will also be gained
in the matter of, for example, handling device-mapper events while
simultaneously handling a D-Bus method.</p>
<p>This change introduces a relaxation of certain properties that held in
the single-threaded case.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a D-Bus method that mutates state and requires an update to the
dbus tree is invoked the changes to the dbus tree resulting from that method
call are not visible until some time after the call has returned as updates
to the dbus tree can only occur after the method has completed. This can
be observed by a client, if the client invokes a second method immediately
after the first has returned. For example, if the client invokes the CreatePool
method and then immediately invokes the GetManagedObjects() method, some
pool object paths corresponding to the pool or its devices may not yet
be present in the tree. The opposite behavior can also be observed, for
example, if the client invokes the DestroyPool method, some object paths
belonging to the destroyed pool may still be found by a GetManagedObjects()
invocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two D-Bus methods are invoked in separate processes, the same behaviors
described in (1) are somewhat easier to observe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe that we have made it impossible to incorrectly update the
tree by returning rich result types from the engine methods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given two distinct mutating D-Bus methods running in separate threads
there is a possibility of a situation rather analogous to a race-condition
arising. Two tasks may read the dbus tree, update the internal engine state,
and then send update messages on the dbus channel. It is uncertain which
task will acquire the engine mutex. This is
partially analogous to the classic race-condition where two processes read a
single variable, and then both update that variable in an undetermined order.</p>
<p>What makes this analogy only partial is the interposition of the engine,
which restricts the updates that may be requested of the DbusTreeHandler by
the DbusRequestHandler. The engine methods invoked by the D-Bus layer return
a result which sufficiently distinguishes the actions actually taken by
the engine so that conflicting updates to the dbus tree can not be
requested. Thus the updates are constrained to be correct.</p>
<p>For example, consider that two conflicting commands may be handled at the
same time: one command to delete a filesystem and the other to rename
the same filesystem. If both commands are being handled in separate threads
each will read the same data based on the filesystem object. Then, either
one may enter the engine mutex. If the rename task enters the mutex first,
it will be the first to place a message on the dbus channel. The DbusTreeHandler
will remove the rename message first and then the remove message placed
on the dbus channel after the remove request completes. Clearly,
this order of processing can not result in an error. With the other order,
the remove message will be placed on the dbus channel before the rename
occurs. But in this case, the engine method will return a result indicating
that no rename could occur, because the filesystem could not be found.
Consequently, no rename message will be put on the dbus channel, and so the
DbusTreeHandler will receive the remove message only. Thus, no incorrect
update is performed on the dbus tree.</p>
<h2 id="error-behavior">Error Behavior</h2>
<p><code>stratisd</code> exits if any task returns an error, using the same mechanism
and general procedure that it uses on receipt of SIGINT. Causes of error
may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an error when polling for udev events</li>
<li>an error when polling for device-mapper events</li>
<li>failure to properly set up a D-Bus connection on startup</li>
<li>an error when consuming a message on one of the <code>stratisd</code> channels</li>
</ul>
<p>A properly handled error within the <code>stratisd</code> engine will not
result in the termination of any tasks. In the case of a D-Bus method call,
for example, an error result is interpreted by the D-Bus layer, and some
representation of that error is then incorporated into the message returned
on the D-Bus.</p>
<p>We have taken great care to avoid panics within <code>stratisd</code>. Nonetheless,
it is reasonable to discuss possible behavior on any panic which may
occur.</p>
<p>If one of the dynamically spawned DbusTreeHandler tasks experiences a panic
while executing, <code>stratisd</code> will not be terminated. Only the currently running
task will fail to complete.  When a new D-Bus message is received, a new task
will be spawned and will execute as usual.</p>
<p>However, a panic that occurs during the execution of a task like the
udev event handling task, of which there is only one spawned when
<code>stratisd</code> is started, will cause <code>stratisd</code> to exit.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-a-clean-and-prompt-exit">Ensuring a Clean and Prompt Exit</h2>
<p>On SIGINT, <code>stratisd</code> should exit promptly and cleanly. This is ensured by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having a separate signal handling task that waits on SIGINT. The <code>tokio</code>
scheduler will ensure that this task is run regularly; thus the signal
can not be ignored. Note that in the single-threaded case it is possible
for the signal handling code never to be reached.</li>
<li>Causing asynchronous tasks to terminate at their next synchronization point
when the signal handling task terminates.</li>
<li>Having the udev event handling loop check the flag set by the signal
handling task on every iteration, and terminate if the flag
is true.</li>
<li>Each distinct D-Bus method processing task is allowed to run to completion,
so that every action that it has begun can be completed.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="statistics">Statistics</h1>
<p>Using <code>tokio</code> increases the size of the <code>stratisd</code> executable by about 1 MiB,
which at <code>stratisd</code>'s current size is an increase of approximately 20%.</p>
<h1 id="remarks">Remarks</h1>
<p>Preliminary multi-threading support will be included in the next <code>stratisd</code>
release, 2.4.0.</p>

<p>Stratis 2.3.0 adds additional flexibility to its encryption support via
<a href="https://github.com/latchset/clevis">Clevis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stratis-2-3-0">stratis 2.3.0</h2>
<p>This release extends the <code>pool unlock</code> command, and adds two new commands,
<code>pool bind</code> and <code>pool unbind</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>pool bind</code> command establishes an alternative mechanism for unlocking
a pool. The user may select either the &quot;tang&quot; mechanism, which implements
NBDE (Network-bound Disc Encryption) by means of a Tang server, or the
&quot;tpm2&quot; mechanism, which uses TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) encryption.
Binding the devices in a pool to a supplementary Clevis encryption policy does
not remove the primary encryption mechanism, which uses a key in the kernel
keyring.</p>
<p>The <code>pool unbind</code> command simply unbinds a previously added encryption
policy from all the devices in the specified pool.</p>
<p>In the <code>pool unlock</code> command it is now necessary to specify the mechanism.
Use <code>clevis</code> to make use of the Clevis unlocking policy previously
specified for the devices in the pool. Use <code>keyring</code>, to make use of the
mechanism that uses a key in the kernel keyring, which was introduced
in Stratis 2.1.0. Note that the <code>pool unlock</code> command unlocks all currently
locked pools.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-3-0">stratisd 2.3.0</h2>
<p>This release introduces two D-Bus interface revisions, which differ in the
following way from the previous revisions.</p>
<p><code>org.storage.stratis2.Manager.r3</code> modifies the <code>UnlockPool</code> method to take
an additional parameter, <code>unlock_method</code>, which may be <code>keyring</code> or <code>clevis</code>.</p>
<p><code>org.storage.stratis2.pool.r3</code> adds two new method: <code>Bind</code> and <code>Unbind</code>.
The <code>Bind</code> method takes two arguments, <code>pin</code> and <code>json</code>. The <code>pin</code> argument
designates the Clevis pin as a string, and the <code>json</code> argument encodes
a Clevis configuration appropriate to the designated pin. The configuration
is a JSON object. Besides Clevis information, it may include Stratis-specific
keys that encode configuration decisions that Stratis may implement. At
present there is just one such key: <code>stratis:tang:trust_url</code>.
The <code>Unbind</code> method reverses a <code>Bind</code> action.</p>
<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <code>Bind</code> method may be called with any Clevis pin and configuration;
we expect that any valid Clevis pin and configuration can be used to bind the
devices in a pool. However the Stratis project officially supports only the
&quot;tang&quot; and &quot;tpm2&quot; pins as those are the pins that may be designated via
<code>stratis</code>. Support for additional Clevis policies may be introduced into
<code>stratis</code> in later releases.</p>
<p>When binding a supplementary encryption policy to the devices in a pool
using Clevis, the primary key, which is the key in the kernel keyring which
was originally used to encrypt each device, must be supplied. stratisd
obtains the appropriate key from the kernel keyring in order to provide it
to the Clevis binding mechanism. The correct key must be present in the
keyring for the bind operation to succeed. It is not necessary for the user
to specify the key, stratisd obtains the necessary information from the
LUKS2 metadata on the devices in the pool.</p>
<p>In general, it is unwise to write a key consisting of arbitrary binary data
to a keyfile. An accidental newline character in the data may cause the
contents of the file to be truncated at the newline when read in one context
while all the data may be read from the file in some other context.</p>
<p>We are not aware that such a mistake would result in any error in Stratis's
operation when Stratis is used in the way that we recommend. We explicitly
acknowledge that it might be possible, through some direct interaction with
the stratisd D-Bus API, or by, e.g., setting a key in the kernel keyring
without using stratis, to manufacture a situation where stratisd could not
bind the devices in a pool, even when the correct key is set in the kernel
keyring. We would not treat such a situation as evidence of a bug in Stratis.</p>

<p>Stratis 2.2.1 is a bug fix release. It fixes the following bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was possible to cause stratisd to hang by leaving open a D-Bus
connection when setting a key in the kernel keyring.</li>
<li>stratis would pass as arguments on the D-Bus and stratisd would accept
relative, rather than absolute, path names to specify devices.</li>
<li>Pool and filesystem names that included characters that would be escaped
by udev when constructing filesystem symlinks were permitted.</li>
<li>The man page entry for the <code>key list</code> command was missing.</li>
</ul>

                                <p><em>mulhern, Stratis Team</em></p>
<p>Stratis 2.2.0 now places Stratis filesystem symlinks in <code>/dev/stratis</code>,
rather than <code>/stratis</code>. Stratis creates and maintains the symlinks by means
of udev rules, rather than directly via stratisd as previously.
The <code>/stratis</code> directory is neither created nor used by stratisd 2.2.0.</p>
<p>This release places management of the terminal setting for interactive
encryption-key entry in stratisd rather than in stratis-cli.</p>
<p>This release also includes enhancements to the stratisd D-Bus interface,
various bug fixes, and a change in the stratisd CLI specification for
log levels.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-2-0">stratisd 2.2.0</h2>
<p>This release creates and maintains Stratis filesystem symlinks in
<code>/dev/stratis</code> by means of udev rules. It includes a small Rust script,
<code>stratis_uuids_to_names</code> which is invoked by the Stratis udev rule which
sets the Stratis filesystem symlinks.</p>
<p>In the case where stratisd is updated in place, some filesystem symlinks
may remain in <code>/stratis</code>. This release includes a shell script,
<code>stratis_migrate_symlinks.sh</code> which may be used to clean up the <code>/stratis</code>
directory and ensure that the correct symlinks exist in <code>/dev/stratis</code>. The
script removes the <code>/stratis</code> directory once it has completed without error.
The shell script relies on a small Rust script, <code>stratis_dbusquery_version</code>
which is included with this version of stratisd.</p>
<p>This release also extends the D-Bus interface in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It sends <code>org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager.InterfacesAdded</code>and
<code>org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager.InterfacesRemoved</code> signals on the
D-Bus whenever a D-Bus object is added to or removed from the D-Bus
interface.</li>
<li>It adds a new D-Bus property, <code>PhysicalPath</code>, for the 
<code>org.storage.stratis2.blockdev.r2</code> interface. This property is
principally useful for encrypted Stratis block devices; it identifies
the block device on which the Stratis LUKS2 metadata resides.</li>
<li>It adds a new key, <code>LockedPools</code>, to the
<code>org.storage.stratis2.FetchProperties.r2</code> interface for objects that
implement the <code>org.storage.stratis2.Manager</code> interface. This key
returns a D-Bus object that maps the UUIDs of locked pools to their
corresponding key descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.</p>

                                <p><em>mulhern, Stratis Team</em></p>
<p>Stratis 2.1.0 introduces support for encryption.</p>
<p>It supports per-pool encryption of the devices that form a pool's data
tier. A pool may be encrypted, or its constituent encrypted devices may
be activated, by means of a key stored in the kernel keyring.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-1-0">stratisd 2.1.0</h2>
<p>This release implements encryption support and adds several new D-Bus
interfaces to administer or monitor that support.</p>
<p>It implements encryption support in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single instance of stratisd can support both encrypted and unencrypted
pools.</li>
<li>The choice to encrypt a pool must be made at the time a pool is created.</li>
<li>At present, the use of a cache and of encryption are mutually exclusive;
if the pool is created with encryption enabled, then it is not possible
to create a cache.</li>
<li>Each pool may be encrypted by means of a key in the kernel keyring; each
encrypted pool may make use of a different key, but all devices in a pool
are encrypted with a single key.</li>
<li>Any additional devices that are added to an encrypted pool's data tier
will be encrypted using the key that was specified when the pool was
initialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>stratisd 2.1.0 supplies several new D-Bus interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.manager.r1</code>: This interface supplies an
extended <code>CreatePool</code> method, to support an optional argument for
encryption. In addition, it supplies a number of method for key
management.</li>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.pool.r1</code>: This interface supports explicit
initialization of a cache tier. Previously, a cache was initialized as
a side-effect of the addition of the first device to the cache tier.
It also supports the new <code>Encrypted</code> property.</li>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.FetchProperties.r1</code>: This interface supports an
additional <code>HasCache</code> property.</li>
<li><code>org.storage.stratis2.Report.r1</code>: This interface supports a set of
ad-hoc reports about Stratis. The interface is unstable; the names by
which the reports can be accesed are not guaranteed to remain stable,
and the format of any report is only guaranteed to be valid JSON.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.</p>
<p>The following are significant implementation details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each block device in an encrypted pool's data tier is encrypted with a
distinct, randomly chosen MEK (Media Encryption Key) on initialization.</li>
<li>All devices belonging to a single encrypted pool share a single passphrase,
supplied via the kernel keyring.</li>
<li>The release requires cryptsetup version 2.3.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to thank our external contributor GuillaumeGomez for further
work on metadata refactoring (<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1573">stratisd issue 1573</a>).</p>
<h2 id="stratis-cli-2-1-0">stratis-cli 2.1.0</h2>
<p>This release requires stratisd 2.1.0. The user will observe the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>pool create</code> command has been extended to allow encryption.</li>
<li>There is a new <code>pool init_cache</code> command, for initializing a cache.</li>
<li>There is a new subcommand, <code>key</code>, for key management tasks.</li>
<li>There is a new subcommand, <code>report</code>, which allows the display of certain
reports generated by stratisd.</li>
<li>The output of <code>pool list</code> now includes a <code>Properties</code> column; each
entry in the column is a string encoding the following properties of the
pool:
<ul>
<li>whether or not it has a cache</li>
<li>whether or not it is encrypted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All commands now verify that stratis is communicating with a compatible
version of stratisd and will fail with an appropriate error if stratisd is
found to have an incompatible version.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To create an encrypted pool, a user must first ensure that a key is placed
in the kernel keyring. We strongly encourage using the commands available
via the stratis <code>key</code> subcommand for this task. This key, which is secret,
has a corresponding key description, which is public.</p>
<p>An encrypted pool is then created by specifying the key description
when using the <code>pool create</code> command.</p>
<p>It is necessary that the correct key and corresponding key description be set
in the kernel keyring in order to set up a previously encrypted pool. Setting
up a previously encrypted pool requires an explicit <code>pool unlock</code> command from
the user. This command will attempt to unlock the devices belonging to any
previously encrypted pool; it can only unlock all devices if a key for every
encrypted pool is in the keyring. Once the devices belonging to a previously
encrypted pool have been unlocked, the pool will be set up, and can be used in
exactly the same manner as an unencrypted pool.</p>

<p>One major focus in the Stratis project recently has been adding an encryption layer
for data in Stratis pools. Cryptsetup provides a library backend for programmatically
setting up device encryption, so we decided to write Rust bindings to access the
existing Cryptsetup functionality in Rust.</p>
<p>While designing the bindings, we took every opportunity to make use of Rust's
type system, leveraging features like reference lifetimes and type parameters
to ensure that as much of our public API as possible can be validated by the
compiler.</p>
<p>Though these bindings were designed with Stratis in mind, it is intended
to be general-purpose and so we encourage others to try it out. The license
is MPLv2, but it becomes effectively GPL when linked with libcryptsetup.
As a result, any project using our bindings will also need to be GPL or
GPL-compatible.</p>

<p>Stratis 2.0 is a significant update for both the daemon and the CLI. The
changes to the daemon are covered first, followed by the changes to the
CLI.</p>
<h2 id="stratisd-2-0-0">stratisd 2.0.0</h2>
<p>This release makes the D-Bus API more robust, reliable, predictable, and
extensible. There are several significant changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The set of D-Bus properties has been reduced to a core set of fundamental
and stable properties. Other filesystem, pool, or block devices properties are
now obtainable via methods in the <code>FetchProperties</code> interface. This change
increases the robustness of the D-Bus interface to failures occurring in any
particular pool, filesystem, or block device, and decreases the computational
cost of most operations requested by the Stratis CLI. Several properties,
formerly returned as D-Bus properties, are now unavailable by means of the
D-Bus. In every case, the reason for removing the property was that it did not
represent a well-defined value. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/52">project issue 52</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All D-Bus method calls are idempotent. This should make writing scripts
using the D-Bus API much simpler and make reasoning about the behavior
of the engine more straightforward. Henceforth, we will treat as a bug any
non-idempotent behavior in the D-Bus API. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/51">project issue 51</a> for further
details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All D-Bus size values are now returned in bytes. Again, this should make
writing scripts against the D-Bus more straightforward, since it will be
unnecessary for the script writer to change their interpretation of the number
returned on the D-Bus depending on the value that it represents. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1243">stratisd issue 1243</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements to the D-Bus API will be implemented by means of
additional versioned interfaces.</p>
<p>Please consult the D-Bus API Reference for the precise D-Bus specification.</p>
<h2 id="stratis-cli-2-0-0">stratis-cli 2.0.0</h2>
<p>This release requires stratisd 2.0.0. The user will observe the following
significant improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CLI is significantly more robust. Previously, there was a category of
error conditions in pools, filesystems, and block devices that would make the
CLI virtually unusable; this problem has now been entirely resolved. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/52">project issue 52</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CLI now reports errors consistently in conditions where a human user
would generally expect an error to be reported. Previously, many commands in
the CLI were idempotent, to facilitate scripting. Now there is a clear
distinction between the CLI behavior and the stratisd D-Bus API behavior: the
CLI behavior is designed strictly according to the expectations of a human
user, the stratisd D-Bus API is the programmable interface. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/project/issues/51">project issue 51</a> for further details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, anyone wishing to implement a program that uses Stratis for
storage management is strongly advised to make use of the stratisd D-Bus API
rather than the CLI.</p>

<p>With this release stratis now recognizes an environment variable,
<code>STRATIS_DBUS_TIMEOUT</code>. This environment variable controls the timeout for
any individual D-Bus call that stratis makes. You may want to set it to a
higher value than the default, which is 120 seconds, if you are running
tests or otherwise scripting via stratis, and wish to avoid erroneous errors
resulting from slow operations in your testing environment. See
<a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/issues/252">stratis-cli issue 252</a> for further details.</p>
<p>This release also introduces simplified and more complete error-reporting.
For stratis, it constitutes an error if any command issued results in a
Python stack trace. If you experience any such incident, please
report it in a GitHub issue, including the full stack trace, and
circumstances that led up to the incident.</p>

<p>This release includes one significant bug fix and a substantial refactoring.</p>
<p>The bug was caused by an inconsistency in the metadata handling which led to
a failure to properly update the Stratis metadata if stratisd was restarted
in an environment where the system clock indicated a time earlier than when
it had previously been running. See <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/issues/1509">stratisd issue 1509</a> for further
details.</p>

<p>Stratis is a Linux local storage management tool that aims to enable easy use of advanced storage features such as thin provisioning, snapshots, and pool-based management and monitoring.</p>
<p>After two years of development, Stratis 1.0 has stabilized its on-disk metadata format and command-line interface, and is ready for more widespread testing and evaluation by potential users. Stratis is implemented as a daemon – <code>stratisd</code> – as well as a command-line configuration tool called stratis, and works with Linux kernel versions 4.14 and up.</p>

<p>This release is suitable for developers and early testers. It should not be
used with valuable data, and pools created with this release will not be
supported in Stratis 1.0, due to upcoming on-disk format changes.</p>
